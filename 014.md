# `initialize()` functions can be front-run

## Summary
The `initialize()` functions in the contracts such as `OptimismPortal2.sol` & `DelayedWETH.sol` do not have any relevant access control. This allows any arbitrary users to initialize these contracts. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A misconfigured access control can enable attackers to access sensitive data, manipulate system resources, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of existing users.

- An `attacker` could deploy a malicious contract that calls the initialize function of the target contract. 
- Since the `initializer` modifier only prevents reinitialization, it does not prevent the function from being called by an unauthorized address. 
- This could lead to the attacker setting themselves as the `owner` or configuring the contract in a way that benefits them.

## Impact
This means that a malicious user could front run the `initialize()` functions forcing the `deployer` of these contracts  to redeploy.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the initialize function is only callable by the contract's `deployer` or a specific set of `authorized addresses`. This can be achieved by adding an access control mechanism, such as the `Ownable` contract's `onlyOwner` modifier, to the initialize function.
