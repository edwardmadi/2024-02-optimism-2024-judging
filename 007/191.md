# User can frontrun call to setInitBond() whenever a new gameImpl is introduced and create dispute games without paying bonds

## Summary
The dispute game factory contans two storage mappings directly related to dispute game templates: `gameImpls` and `initBonds`. The gameImpls contains the template address for a dispute game and the initBonds contains the initial bonds required to create a dispute game. A user calls the `create()` function to create a new fault dispute game. Normally, the user is required to pay the exact amount of `initBonds` as `msg.value` for creating a dispute game.

However, if the owner of DisputeGameFactory sets the gameImpls and initBonds for a new dispute game in two separate transactions, a malicios user can frontrun the call to initBonds and create a disputeGame without paying initial bonds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a user creates a dispute game the initial bonds must be the exact amount sent as eth in the form of msg.value.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L100
```js
    // If the required initialization bond is not met, revert.
    if (msg.value != initBonds[_gameType]) revert IncorrectBondAmount();
```

If only the gameImpl is set and not the initial bonds for this implementation, the default value is 0. It is not clear in the function documentation what that the initial bonds is 0.

## Impact
User can create a dispute game with no bonds

## Code Snippet
These are the two setter methods in DisputeGameFactory:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L189
```js
    function setImplementation(GameType _gameType, IDisputeGame _impl) external onlyOwner {
        gameImpls[_gameType] = _impl;
        emit ImplementationSet(address(_impl), _gameType);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IDisputeGameFactory
    function setInitBond(GameType _gameType, uint256 _initBond) external onlyOwner {
        initBonds[_gameType] = _initBond;
        emit InitBondUpdated(_gameType, _initBond);
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a call to setInitBonds in the setImplementation() method with a default value or require the initBonds as an input variable.

Alternatively, make sure that the owner contract is only sets the gameImpl and the init bonds at the same time.
