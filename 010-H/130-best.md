# Unvalidated Root Claim in _verifyExecBisectionRoot

## Summary
 logical flaw that can compromise the integrity of the game by allowing invalid root claims to pass under specific conditions.
## Vulnerability Detail

The verifyExecBisectionRoot function is attempts to validate the root claim based on the status provided by the VM and whether the move is an attack or defense, but the logic fails to account for scenarios where the depth and type of move could result in an invalid claim being accepted as valid here 
```solidity
Position disputedLeafPos = Position.wrap(_parentPos.raw() + 1);
        ClaimData storage disputed = _findTraceAncestor({ _pos: disputedLeafPos, _start: _parentIdx, _global: true });
        uint8 vmStatus = uint8(_rootClaim.raw()[0]);

        if (_isAttack || disputed.position.depth() % 2 == SPLIT_DEPTH % 2) {
            // If the move is an attack, the parent output is always deemed to be disputed. In this case, we only need
            // to check that the root claim signals that the VM panicked or resulted in an invalid transition.
            // If the move is a defense, and the disputed output and creator of the execution trace subgame disagree,
            // the root claim should also signal that the VM panicked or resulted in an invalid transition.
            if (!(vmStatus == VMStatuses.INVALID.raw() || vmStatus == VMStatuses.PANIC.raw())) {
                revert UnexpectedRootClaim(_rootClaim);
            }
        } else if (vmStatus != VMStatuses.VALID.raw()) {
            // The disputed output and the creator of the execution trace subgame agree. The status byte should
            // have signaled that the VM succeeded.
            revert UnexpectedRootClaim(_rootClaim);
        }
    }

```
he conditional check if (_isAttack || disputed.position.depth() % 2 == SPLIT_DEPTH % 2) and subsequent logic is flawed in how it determines the validity of a root claim based on the VM status and move type
 let's say a scenario of Attack to occur cause i fuzzed with scenario and i get the same result :
-  An attacker initiates a defense move `(_isAttack is false)` against a root claim with a depth that unevenly aligns with `SPLIT_DEPTH`, ensuring` disputed.position.depth() % 2 == SPLIT_DEPTH % 2 `evaluates to false.
- The attacker submits a root claim with a` VMStatus` of` VALID` when, in reality, the claim should not be considered valid due to the game's state or previous moves.
- as result The contract fails to reject the invalid root claim due to the incorrect logic, allowing the attacker to potentially alter the game's course to their advantage.

## Impact

the issue is allowing the participants to exploit the flaw to their advantage, leading to incorrect game outcomes

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation

in my opening it's need  a  checks or restructuring the conditional logic to prevent invalid claims from being accepted
