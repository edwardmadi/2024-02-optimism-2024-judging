# Inability to deposit bond in `FaultDisputeGame.initialize()`

## Summary
In  `FaultDisputeGame.initialize()`, this function call, `WETH.deposit{ value: msg.value }();` is used to `Deposit the bond` according to the Natspec.
The `IDelayedWETH` interface is declared here as WETH, i.e `IDelayedWETH internal WETH`. However this interface does not implement a `deposit()` function which therefore means that such a function will not work here imparing Bond deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `IDelayedWETH` interface is declared as `WETH` within the contract, but it does not include a `deposit()` function. This means that when the contract attempts to call `WETH.deposit{ value: msg.value }();`, it will fail because the `deposit()` function does not exist in the `IDelayedWETH` interface. 

## Impact
This failure prevents the bond deposits from being processed correctly, which is crucial for the functioning of the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this, ensure that you're using the correct interface and that this interface includes all the functions you intend to use.
