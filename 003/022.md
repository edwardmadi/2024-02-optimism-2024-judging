# Unchecked-send Vulnerability in OptimismPortal2 Contract: A Potential Risk for Loss of Funds

## Summary

The OptimismPortal2 contract is an essential component of the Optimism Rollup system, which allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from Layer 1 (L1) to Layer 2 (L2). This report highlights an unchecked-send vulnerability in the `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function of the contract, which can lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function is responsible for finalizing the withdrawal transaction by calling the target contract using the `SafeCall.callWithMinGas` function. However, the function does not check the return value of the call. If the call fails, the transaction will revert, but the withdrawal will still be marked as finalized. This can lead to loss of funds as the user will not be able to withdraw their funds again.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is high as it can lead to loss of funds. If an attacker can cause the target contract to fail, they can mark a withdrawal as finalized without actually executing it. This can result in the loss of funds for the user who initiated the withdrawal.

The following code snippet shows the vulnerable function:
```scss
function finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        address _proofSubmitter
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Make sure that the l2Sender has not yet been set. The l2Sender is set to a value other
        // than the default value when a withdrawal transaction is being finalized. This check is
        // a defacto reentrancy guard.
        require(
            l2Sender == Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER, "OptimismPortal: can only trigger one withdrawal per transaction"
        );

        // Compute the withdrawal hash.
        bytes32 withdrawalHash = Hashing.hashWithdrawal(_tx);

        // Check that the withdrawal can be finalized.
        checkWithdrawal(withdrawalHash, _proofSubmitter);

        // Mark the withdrawal as finalized so it can't be replayed.
        finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = true;

        // Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.
        l2Sender = _tx.sender;

        // Trigger the call to the target contract. We use a custom low level method
        // SafeCall.callWithMinGas to ensure two key properties
        //   1. Target contracts cannot force this call to run out of gas by returning a very large
        //      amount of data (and this is OK because we don't care about the returndata here).
        //   2. The amount of gas provided to the execution context of the target is at least the
        //      gas limit specified by the user. If there is not enough gas in the current context
        //      to accomplish this, `callWithMinGas` will revert.
        bool success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_tx.target, _tx.gasLimit, _tx.value, _tx.data);

        // Reset the l2Sender back to the default value.
        l2Sender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

        // All withdrawals are immediately finalized. Replayability can
        // be achieved through contracts built on top of this contract
        emit WithdrawalFinalized(withdrawalHash, success);

        // Reverting here is useful for determining the exact gas cost to successfully execute the
        // sub call to the target contract if the minimum gas limit specified by the user would not
        // be sufficient to execute the sub call.
        if (!success && tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
            revert("OptimismPortal: withdrawal failed");
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to add a check on the return value of the `SafeCall.callWithMinGas` function. If the call fails, the transaction should revert, and the withdrawal should not be marked as finalized. The updated code snippet is as follows:
```scss
function finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof(
        Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
        address _proofSubmitter
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Make sure that the l2Sender has not yet been set. The l2Sender is set to a value other
        // than the default value when a withdrawal transaction is being finalized. This check is
        // a defacto reentrancy guard.
        require(
            l2Sender == Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER, "OptimismPortal: can only trigger one withdrawal per transaction"
        );

        // Compute the withdrawal hash.
        bytes32 withdrawalHash = Hashing.hashWithdrawal(_tx);

        // Check that the withdrawal can be finalized.
        checkWithdrawal(withdrawalHash, _proofSubmitter);

        // Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.
        l2Sender = _tx.sender;

        // Trigger the call to the target contract. We use a custom low level method
        // SafeCall.callWithMinGas to ensure two key properties
        //   1. Target contracts cannot force this call to run out of gas by returning a very large
        //      amount of data (and this is OK because we don't care about the returndata here).
        //   2. The amount of gas provided to the execution context of the target is at least the
        //      gas limit specified by the user. If there is not enough gas in the current context
        //      to accomplish this, `callWithMinGas` will revert.
        bool success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_tx.target, _tx.gasLimit, _tx.value, _tx.data);

        // Reset the l2Sender back to the default value.
        l2Sender = Constants.DEFAULT_L2_SENDER;

        // If the call fails, revert the transaction and do not mark the withdrawal as finalized.
        require(success, "OptimismPortal: withdrawal failed");

        // Mark the withdrawal as finalized so it can't be replayed.
        finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = true;

        // All withdrawals are immediately finalized. Replayability can
        // be achieved through contracts built on top of this contract
        emit WithdrawalFinalized(withdrawalHash, success);
    }
