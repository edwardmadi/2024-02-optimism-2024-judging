# Withdrawal can be finalized without calling the target contract

## Summary
During withdrawal transaction finalization, if the call to the target contract fails, it still is considered finalized and hence that message cannot be passed again. This can lead to loss of funds too as ETH is locked in `OptimismPortal2` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the call to the target contract during withdrawal finalization phase fails, it's still set to finalized status without actually transferring eth or passing the message to the target contract. Once it's finalized in `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof()` (an open access function), the withdrawal transaction can be be executed again.

## Impact
Failed withdrawal transactions are finalized.

```solidity
finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = true;
...
bool success = SafeCall.callWithMinGas(_tx.target, _tx.gasLimit, _tx.value, _tx.data);
...
if (!success && tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS) {
    revert("OptimismPortal: withdrawal failed");
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Finalize a withdrawal only when the call to target call succeeds or give users an option to bump up the gas quota if the call fails due to out-of-gas.
