# Dispute game that resolves correctly can still end up being blacklisted.

## Summary
According to `blacklistDisputeGame()` function Natspec:
```solidity
/// @notice Blacklists a dispute game. Should only be used in the event that a dispute game resolves incorrectly.
```
However, the function does not check if a dispute game has resolved correctly or not before blacklisting.

## Vulnerability Detail
#### Exploit scenario:
`Alice, guardian()`,  invokes the `blacklistDisputeGame()` function without any check to verify whether the dispute resolution was correct or not. 
As a result:
The dispute game, despite resolving correctly,  gets blacklisted.

## Impact
Without a check to verify the correctness of the dispute resolution before blacklisting, there is a risk that the function could be misused or invoked prematurely, leading to unintended consequences such as blacklisting valid dispute games.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation steps to confirm the correctness of dispute resolutions before allowing blacklisting actions to be executed.
