# reentrancy attack may happen in "initialize()"

## Summary
when calling the initialize function we are initially keeping initialized variable as false. Then we are calling the  
" WETH.deposit{ value: msg.value }();" function but if WETH contract is not trusted  or can cause calling of initialize function again ,this may cause a reentrancy  as our initialized is false till now.
## Vulnerability Detail
function initialize() public payable virtual {
        // SAFETY: Any revert in this function will bubble up to the DisputeGameFactory and
        // prevent the game from being created.
        //
        // Implicit assumptions:
        // - The `gameStatus` state variable defaults to 0, which is `GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS`
        // - The dispute game factory will enforce the required bond to initialize the game.
        //
        // Explicit checks:
        // - The game must not have already been initialized.
        // - An output root cannot be proposed at or before the starting block number.

        // INVARIANT: The game must not have already been initialized.
        if (initialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();

        // Grab the latest anchor root.
        (Hash root, uint256 rootBlockNumber) = ANCHOR_STATE_REGISTRY.anchors(GAME_TYPE);

        // Should only happen if this is a new game type that hasn't been set up yet.
        if (root.raw() == bytes32(0)) revert AnchorRootNotFound();

        // Set the starting output root.
        startingOutputRoot = OutputRoot({ l2BlockNumber: rootBlockNumber, root: root });

        // Do not allow the game to be initialized if the root claim corresponds to a block at or before the
        // configured starting block number.
        if (l2BlockNumber() <= rootBlockNumber) revert UnexpectedRootClaim(rootClaim());

        // Revert if the calldata size is too large, which signals that the `extraData` contains more than expected.
        // This is to prevent adding extra bytes to the `extraData` that result in a different game UUID in the factory,
        // but are not used by the game, which would allow for multiple dispute games for the same output proposal to
        // be created.
        // Expected length: 0x66 (0x04 selector + 0x20 root claim + 0x20 l1 head + 0x20 extraData + 0x02 CWIA bytes)
        assembly {
            if gt(calldatasize(), 0x66) {
                // Store the selector for `ExtraDataTooLong()` & revert
                mstore(0x00, 0xc407e025)
                revert(0x1C, 0x04)
            }
        }

        // Set the root claim
        claimData.push(
            ClaimData({
                parentIndex: type(uint32).max,
                counteredBy: address(0),
                claimant: tx.origin,
                bond: uint128(msg.value),
                claim: rootClaim(),
                position: ROOT_POSITION,
                clock: LibClock.wrap(Duration.wrap(0), Timestamp.wrap(uint64(block.timestamp)))
            })
        );

        // Deposit the bond.
@>>        WETH.deposit{ value: msg.value }();

        // Set the game's starting timestamp
        createdAt = Timestamp.wrap(uint64(block.timestamp));

        // Set the game as initialized.
  @>>      initialized = true;
    }

## Recommendation
    // Deposit the bond.
  @>>      initialized = true;
@>>        WETH.deposit{ value: msg.value }();

        // Set the game's starting timestamp
        createdAt = Timestamp.wrap(uint64(block.timestamp));

        // Set the game as initialized.
