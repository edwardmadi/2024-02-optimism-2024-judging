# Agreement Misinterpretation in Step Function Causes Dispute Resolution Issues

## Summary
A logic flaw has been identified in the step function of the FaultDisputeGame contract, which may result in the incorrect 
reversal of valid defense steps during the dispute resolution process.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L142-L220

## Vulnerability Detail

The step function is intended to validate a single VM execution step by comparing the expected pre and post states. 
The function uses a conditional statement that incorrectly treats the validity of a defense step as being equivalent 
to the agreement between the parent and found poststates. This logic does not align with the intended game mechanics 
and may cause the function to revert a transaction even when a defense step is correctly executed and should be accepted 
as valid.


## Impact
If not corrected, this bug could allow attackers to challenge valid defense steps, potentially leading to incorrect 
dispute outcomes. This could undermine the integrity of the dispute resolution process and the fairness of the game, 
affecting the trust in the contract's ability to adjudicate disputes correctly.

## Code Snippet
The problematic code is as follows:

```solidity
bool validStep = VM.step(_stateData, _proof, uuid.raw()) == postState.claim.raw();
bool parentPostAgree = (parentPos.depth() - postState.position.depth()) % 2 == 0;
if (parentPostAgree == validStep) revert ValidStep();
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The conditional logic should be revised to accurately reflect the intended validation process for both attack and defense 
scenarios. The recommended change is to separate the logic for attacks and defenses:

```solidity
if (_isAttack) {
    // For an attack, revert if the VM step does not produce a different poststate.
    if (validStep) revert InvalidStep();
} else {
    // For a defense, revert only if there's a mismatch between the agreement and the VM step validity.
    if (parentPostAgree != validStep) revert InvalidStep();
}
```

This change ensures that for an attack, the step is only considered valid if it results in a poststate different from the 
parent claim's poststate. For a defense, the step is considered valid if the agreement between the parent claim's poststate 
and the found poststate is consistent with the VM execution result.

Implementing this recommendation will prevent the incorrect rejection of valid defense steps and maintain the integrity 
of the dispute resolution mechanism within the FaultDisputeGame contract.
