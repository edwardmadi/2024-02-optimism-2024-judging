# Users cannot create a new game or proposal if the old game is blacklisted

## Summary

Users cannot create a new game or proposal if the old game is blacklisted. The revert happens on this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L113) as both old and new games have the same `UUID`

## Vulnerability Detail

If a game is blacklisted, the `UUID` will remain the same because `_gameType, _rootClaim, _extraData` are still the same. So when creating a new proposal or game, the same `UUID` from the old game will be used.




From [DisputeGameFactory::create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L110)
```solidity
    // Compute the unique identifier for the dispute game.
    Hash uuid = getGameUUID(_gameType, _rootClaim, _extraData);
```

From [FaultDisputeGame::initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L541-L545) 

```solidity

    // Revert if the calldata size is too large, which signals that the `extraData` contains more than expected.
    // This is to prevent adding extra bytes to the `extraData` that result in a different game UUID in the factory,
    // but are not used by the game, which would allow for multiple dispute games for the same output proposal to
    // be created.
    // Expected length: 0x66 (0x04 selector + 0x20 root claim + 0x20 l1 head + 0x20 extraData + 0x02 CWIA bytes)
```

From the comments and revert lines shown below, we can understand that the protocol allows users to create a new game or proposal if the old game is blacklisted. So, if a user tries to call [DisputeGameFactory::create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L113) to prove the withdrawal again, the revert line triggers because the `uuid` is the same and it points to the gameID of the previous game and it is `!= bytes32(0)`. 

So the revert triggers, and users can never prove or resolve that withdrawal transaction. And a new withdrawal transaction with different nonce has to be created, and again, 7 days of challenging period awaits.  

From [OptimismPortal2::proveWithdrawalTransaction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L280-L291)

```solidity
        // We generally want to prevent users from proving the same withdrawal multiple times
        // because each successive proof will update the timestamp. A malicious user can take
        // advantage of this to prevent other users from finalizing their withdrawal. However,
        // in the case that an honest user proves their withdrawal against a dispute game that
@>      // resolves against the root claim, or the dispute game is blacklisted, we allow
        // re-proving the withdrawal against a new proposal.
        IDisputeGame oldGame = provenWithdrawal.disputeGameProxy;
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS
                || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"
        );
```

From [DisputeGameFactory::create](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L113)

```solidity
        // If a dispute game with the same UUID already exists, revert.
        if (GameId.unwrap(_disputeGames[uuid]) != bytes32(0)) revert GameAlreadyExists(uuid); 
```




## Impact

Users can never prove or resolve the game of a withdrawal transaction if the old game with the same `uuid` is blacklisted. And a new withdrawal transaction with different nonce has to be created, and again, 7 days of challenging period awaits. The invariant or feature is missing here. That is the issue.

## Recommendation

Before reverting [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol#L113) check if the game with the same `UUID` is blacklisted or not. Skip the revert if the game is blacklisted.
