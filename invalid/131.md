# Silent Failure in WETH Withdrawal

## Summary
The function assumes that the external call to WETH.withdraw will always succeed without performing any checks on the operation's success. This assumption overlooks potential for non-reverting failures in external contract calls, the assumption overlooks   for non-reverting failures in external contract calls, which can lead to a state where a user's credit is zeroed out without the corresponding ETH being successfully transferred to the user's account.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function claimCredit(address _recipient) external {
    uint256 recipientCredit = credit[_recipient];
    credit[_recipient] = 0;

    if (recipientCredit == 0) {
        revert NoCreditToClaim();
    }

    WETH.withdraw(_recipient, recipientCredit);  // <-- 

    (bool success,) = _recipient.call{value: recipientCredit}("");
    if (!success) revert BondTransferFailed();
}
```
the vulnerability is the incorrect assumption that the external WETH.withdraw call will always succeed. 
The contract's failure to account for the possibility of non-reverting failures in external contract interactions it's leads to a discrepancy between the contract's state and the actual asset holdings, and posing a   risk to user funds.

In a scenario where the WETH.withdraw call fails silently  as an example does not revert the transaction but does not execute as intended, the user's credited balance is unjustly reduced without receiving the equivalent ETH. and This discrepancy can lead to loss of fund for users 
## Impact
it's can lead to loss of fund for users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the transaction should revert to ensure the user's credited balance and need  a check the success of the WETH.withdraw operation
