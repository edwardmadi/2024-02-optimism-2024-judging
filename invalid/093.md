# DelayedWETH Contract Owner Can Recover ETH Even When the Contract is Not Paused

## Summary
See Below
## Vulnerability Detail
The `recover` function in the `DelayedWETH` contract allows the contract owner to withdraw Ether (`ETH`) from the contract without verifying whether the contract is in a paused state. Below is the code snippet representing the `recover` function:
```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
function recover(uint256 _wad) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
    uint256 amount = _wad < address(this).balance ? _wad : address(this).balance;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```
The function validates that the caller is the contract owner.
Upon satisfying this condition, it proceeds to withdraw the specified amount of Ether (_wad) from the contract's balance and transfer it to the owner's address, without checking whether the contract is in a paused state.
## Impact
The vulnerability permits the contract owner to recover Ether from the contract, even during active contract execution. This could result in unauthorized fund withdrawals or disrupt the normal operation of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Introduce a check within the `recover` function to ensure that it can only execute withdrawals when the contract is in a paused state.
 ```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
function recover(uint256 _wad) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
    require(config.paused(), "DelayedWETH: contract is not paused"); // Add check for paused state
    uint256 amount = _wad < address(this).balance ? _wad : address(this).balance;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
 ```
