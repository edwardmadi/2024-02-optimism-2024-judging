## Vulnerability Detail

The approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. 
It allows the spender to front-run and spend the amount before the new allowance is set

This attack occurs when a token owner authorizes another account to transfer a specific amount of tokens on their behalf. 
If the token owner decides to change that allowance amount, the spender could spend both allowances by front running the 
allowance-changing transaction. To help mitigate this, the OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC20 implementation can be used, along with 
the decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance functions.

## Impact

users could lose ETH when he use approve function.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance instead of approve as OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. Please see details here:
