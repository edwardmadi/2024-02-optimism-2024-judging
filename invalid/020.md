# "Critical Reentrancy Vulnerability in DelayedWETH Contract - Potential Loss of Funds"

## Summary

Potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `recover` function of the DelayedWETH contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `recover` function in the DelayedWETH contract transfers Ether to the owner without updating the state of the contract first. This could potentially allow for a reentrancy attack if the owner is a contract with a fallback function that calls back into the `recover` function.

## Impact

If the owner of the DelayedWETH contract is a contract with a malicious fallback function, the attacker could repeatedly call the `recover` function, draining the contract's Ether balance in a reentrancy attack. This could lead to the loss of funds stored in the contract.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable `recover` function in the DelayedWETH contract:
```solidity
function recover(uint256 _wad) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
    uint256 amount = _wad < address(this).balance ? _wad : address(this).balance;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this potential reentrancy vulnerability, consider updating the `recover` function to follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. In this case, you can add a require statement to ensure that the contract's Ether balance is sufficient before transferring Ether to the owner. Here's an updated version of the `recover` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L85-L89
```solidity
function recover(uint256 _wad) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
    require(_wad <= address(this).balance, "DelayedWETH: insufficient balance");
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_wad);
}
```
By adding the require statement to check the contract's Ether balance, you minimize the risk of reentrancy attacks.
