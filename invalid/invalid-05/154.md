# Non-upgradable Guardian will render the system inoperable in case of compromise

## Summary

According to the [contest README](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/205), the Guardian role is RESTRICTED (explicitly not TRUSTED), thus it may be compromised. Nevertheless, current contract setup doesn't allow to replace the Guardian, leaving the system vulnerable to arbitrary actions (in particular DoS) in case of a compromise.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current system setup:

- [OptimismPortal2 contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol) is non-upgradable. This contract is the the backbone of the Optimism L1 contracts.
- [SuperchainConfig contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SuperchainConfig.sol) is also non-upgradable. `OptimismPortal2` crucially depends on this contract to supply the guardian, who can pause/unpause the system.

The core functions in `OptimismPortal2` - [proveWithdrawalTransaction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L242), [finalizeWithdrawalTransaction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L329), [finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L336) - have the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which will prevent them from executing when the system is paused by the Guardian. In case of the Guardian compromise, `OptimismPortal2` will become non-operational.

## Impact

In case of the RESTRICTED Guardian role compromise, `OptimismPortal2` becomes non-operational due to the missing upgradability of the  `OptimismPortal2` and `SuperchainConfig` contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend to add upgradability to the `SuperchainConfig` contract, in the same way it's implemented for the [SystemConfig contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/SystemConfig.sol).
