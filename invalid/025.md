# Resolve game can running out of gas if subgame array is too large

## Summary

Resolve game can running out of gas

## Vulnerability Detail

WHEN resolve the claim, the code iterate all the items in sub game array

```solidity
uint256[] storage challengeIndices = subgames[_claimIndex];
uint256 challengeIndicesLen = challengeIndices.length;
```

then we call:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < challengeIndicesLen; ++i) {
    uint256 challengeIndex = challengeIndices[i];

    // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve a subgame containing an unresolved claim
    if (subgames[challengeIndex].length != 0) revert OutOfOrderResolution();

    ClaimData storage claim = claimData[challengeIndex];

    // If the child subgame is uncountered and further left than the current left-most counter,
    // update the parent subgame's `countered` address and the current `leftmostCounter`.
    // The left-most correct counter is preferred in bond payouts in order to discourage attackers
    // from countering invalid subgame roots via an invalid defense position. As such positions
    // cannot be correctly countered.
    // Note that correctly positioned defense, but invalid claimes can still be successfully countered.
    if (claim.counteredBy == address(0) && leftmostCounter.raw() > claim.position.raw()) {
        countered = claim.claimant;
        leftmostCounter = claim.position;
    }
}
```

The problem is that when making a move, the data is pushed into the sub games array:

```solidity
// Update the subgame rooted at the parent claim.
subgames[_challengeIndex].push(claimData.length - 1);
```

If there are too many moves against a subgame challange index,

when resolve the claim, the for loop can running out of gas

make it expensive / impossible to resolve the game state and distribute the bond

## Impact

Resolve claim can cause too much gas when iterating over the subgame challanges

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider iterate over the subgame in batch if the subgame array length given a index is too large.
