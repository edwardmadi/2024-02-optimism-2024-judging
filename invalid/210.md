# The timestamp of the game's global resolution can always get modified even after already set

## Summary
The timestamp of the game's global resolution can always get modified even after already set

## Vulnerability Detail
Once the absolute root subgame has been resolved, the resolve() function can be called by anyone which sets the final timestamp of the game's global resolution, `resolvedAt`:
```solidity
 function resolve() external returns (GameStatus status_) {
        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the game is currently in progress.
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();

        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the absolute root subgame has been resolved.
        if (!subgameAtRootResolved) revert OutOfOrderResolution();

        // Update the global game status; The dispute has concluded.
        status_ = claimData[0].counteredBy == address(0) ? GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS : GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS;
        resolvedAt = Timestamp.wrap(uint64(block.timestamp)); // @audit

        // Update the status and emit the resolved event, note that we're performing an assignment here.
        emit Resolved(status = status_);

        // Try to update the anchor state, this should not revert.
        ANCHOR_STATE_REGISTRY.tryUpdateAnchorState();
    }
  ```
As you can see, this function can be executed again and would still pass, modifying the timestamp of the game's global resolution again on every execution.

## Impact
The timestamp of the game's global resolution can always get modified even after already set

## Recommendation
Check if `resolvedAt` has already been set before setting it.
