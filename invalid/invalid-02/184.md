# Missing msg.value Check in depositTransaction Function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L395-L436
## Summary
The depositTransaction() function lacks a check on the msg.value, which allows users to send lesser amounts of ETH than the amount entered into the uint256 _value without validation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not verify the value of msg.value (the amount of ETH sent with the transaction).
Without this check, users most especially contracts calling the OptimismPortal2.sol can deposit any amount of ETH,  most probable lesser than stipulated amounts, leading to errors with eth balance of the protocol
## Impact
critical as User/contracts spends less on eth whereby receiving higher amounts during transactions
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 /// @notice Accepts deposits of ETH and data, and emits a TransactionDeposited event for use in
    ///         deriving deposit transactions. Note that if a deposit is made by a contract, its
    ///         address will be aliased when retrieved using `tx.origin` or `msg.sender`. Consider
    ///         using the CrossDomainMessenger contracts for a simpler developer experience.
    /// @param _to         Target address on L2.
    /// @param _value      ETH value to send to the recipient.
    /// @param _gasLimit   Amount of L2 gas to purchase by burning gas on L1.
    /// @param _isCreation Whether or not the transaction is a contract creation.
    /// @param _data       Data to trigger the recipient with.
    function depositTransaction(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        bool _isCreation,
        bytes memory _data
    )
        public
        payable
        metered(_gasLimit)
    {
        // Just to be safe, make sure that people specify address(0) as the target when doing
        // contract creations.
        if (_isCreation) {
            require(_to == address(0), "OptimismPortal: must send to address(0) when creating a contract");
        }

        // Prevent depositing transactions that have too small of a gas limit. Users should pay
        // more for more resource usage.
        require(_gasLimit >= minimumGasLimit(uint64(_data.length)), "OptimismPortal: gas limit too small");

        // Prevent the creation of deposit transactions that have too much calldata. This gives an
        // upper limit on the size of unsafe blocks over the p2p network. 120kb is chosen to ensure
        // that the transaction can fit into the p2p network policy of 128kb even though deposit
        // transactions are not gossipped over the p2p network.
        require(_data.length <= 120_000, "OptimismPortal: data too large");

        // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
        address from = msg.sender;
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
            from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
        }

        // Compute the opaque data that will be emitted as part of the TransactionDeposited event.
        // We use opaque data so that we can update the TransactionDeposited event in the future
        // without breaking the current interface.
        bytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(msg.value, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data);

        // Emit a TransactionDeposited event so that the rollup node can derive a deposit
        // transaction for this deposit.
        emit TransactionDeposited(from, _to, DEPOSIT_VERSION, opaqueData);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that msg.value is equal to the stipulated amount.

```solidity
  require(msg.value == _value, "incorrect eth value");
```
