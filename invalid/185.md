# EOA's depositing on L2 will lose their funds if they do not control same address on L2.

## Summary
EOAs are given the functionality to simply forward ETH to the OptimismPortal2 contract, and a deposit to L2 is made. The issue is the from address that the ETH is minted to is set to the user's L1 address but users are not able to control the same address on all chains, causing the ETH minted to the user's address on L2 to be lost forever if the user isn't in control of  same address on L2. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When funds are sent directly to the OptimismPortal2 trigger the receive() function which initiates a deposit to L2.

```solidity
    /// @notice Accepts value so that users can send ETH directly to this contract and have the
    ///         funds be deposited to their address on L2. This is intended as a convenience
    ///         function for EOAs. Contracts should call the depositTransaction() function directly
    ///         otherwise any deposited funds will be lost due to address aliasing.
    receive() external payable {
        depositTransaction(msg.sender, msg.value, RECEIVE_DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT, false, bytes(""));
    }

```
The issue is that on the call to depositTransaction() the from address is set to the msg.sender which is later on included in deposit event:
```solidity
    function depositTransaction(
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        bool _isCreation,
        bytes memory _data
    )
        public
        payable
        metered(_gasLimit)
    {
..SNIP..
        // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
        address from = msg.sender;
        if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
            from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
        }

        // Compute the opaque data that will be emitted as part of the TransactionDeposited event.
        // We use opaque data so that we can update the TransactionDeposited event in the future
        // without breaking the current interface.
        bytes memory opaqueData = abi.encodePacked(msg.value, _value, _gasLimit, _isCreation, _data);

        // Emit a TransactionDeposited event so that the rollup node can derive a deposit
        // transaction for this deposit.
        emit TransactionDeposited(from, _to, DEPOSIT_VERSION, opaqueData);
    }
```
## Impact
EOAs who use the receive functionality to make deposits to L2 will lose their funds in the do not control same address on L2.

## Recommendation
Enforce users call the depositTransaction() function to initiate deposits to L2
