# Potential Loss of ETH due to Unauthorized Withdrawals

## Summary
The `DelayedWETH` contract allows users to withdraw ETH after a specified delay. However, the withdraw function is currently public, which means any address can call it to initiate a withdrawal. This poses a risk of potential loss of ETH to malicious actors who may exploit the contract by initiating unauthorized withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail
- **Unlock Function**: The `unlock` function allows any address to trigger a withdrawal unlock for a specific account (`_guy`) with a specified amount (`_wad`) of WETH. This function enables accounts to prepare for withdrawals by unlocking WETH after a certain condition is met, such as dispute resolution.
- The `unlock` function is public, allowing any address to invoke it. This can potentially lead to misuse or unauthorized unlocking of WETH.
- While unlocking WETH is a legitimate operation, the lack of access control in this function may allow malicious actors to unlock WETH without proper authorization.
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }
```
- **Withdraw Function**: The `withdraw` function permits any address to withdraw a specified amount of WETH from a specified account after the withdrawal delay has passed. This function is critical for facilitating actual withdrawals from the contract.
- The `withdraw` function, also public, lacks proper access control mechanisms. Any address can call this function to withdraw WETH, regardless of authorization.
This vulnerability creates a scenario where a malicious actor could exploit unlocked WETH by initiating unauthorized withdrawals after the withdrawal delay has passed.
```solidity

    /// @inheritdoc IWETH
    function withdraw(uint256 _wad) public override(WETH98, IWETH) {
        withdraw(msg.sender, _wad);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
    function withdraw(address _guy, uint256 _wad) public {
        require(!config.paused(), "DelayedWETH: contract is paused");
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        require(wd.amount >= _wad, "DelayedWETH: insufficient unlocked withdrawal");
        require(wd.timestamp > 0, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal not unlocked");
        require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS <= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
        wd.amount -= _wad;
        super.withdraw(_wad);
    }
```
- **Recover Function**: The `recover` function enables the contract owner to recover excess ETH from the contract. This function provides a mechanism for the contract owner to retrieve any surplus funds held within the contract.
- The `recover` function, although restricted to the contract owner, does not prevent unauthorized parties from draining the contract through other means (e.g., exploiting the `withdraw` function).
Malicious actors could potentially trigger unauthorized withdrawals of unlocked WETH and drain the contract before the owner can recover the excess ETH.
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
    function recover(uint256 _wad) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
        uint256 amount = _wad < address(this).balance ? _wad : address(this).balance;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
```
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that the contract owner might lose the amount of ETH intended to be recovered from error cases due to unauthorized withdrawals by malicious actors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Access control should be enforced to restrict who can call the `withdraw` function.
