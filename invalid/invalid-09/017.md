# Dispute resolution mechanism can be flawed by calling  `attack()` and `defend()` on the same claim

## Summary
The `attack()` and `defend()` functions in the provided smart contract are designed to allow users to participate in dispute resolution by making moves against or in support of claims. Both functions internally call the move() function, which encapsulates the logic for making a move.

The potential vulnerability arises from the possibility of a user calling both `attack()` and `defend()` on the same claim. This scenario could lead to a race condition or a conflict of interest, where the outcome of the claim is not as intended due to the simultaneous or sequential execution of these functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the potential for a user to exploit the system by strategically calling these functions in a way that benefits them. For example, a user could call `attack()` to initiate a claim and then immediately call `defend()` to counteract the attack, potentially manipulating the outcome of the claim to their advantage.

## Impact
This vulnerability could undermine the integrity of the contract's dispute resolution mechanism. If users can manipulate the outcome of claims by calling `attack()` and `defend()` on the same claim, it could lead to disputes over the validity of claims and the distribution of rewards or penalties. This could harm the reputation of the contract and discourage users from participating in the dispute resolution process.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should implement mechanisms to ensure that a user cannot call `attack()` and `defend()` on the same claim in a way that could lead to a race condition or conflict of interest.
