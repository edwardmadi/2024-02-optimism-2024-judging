# # OptimismPortal2: Unsafe Use of `tx.origin` Enables Contract Bypass

## Summary

The OptimismPortal2 contract uses `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender` to check if the caller is a contract in the `depositTransaction` function. This allows malicious contracts to bypass the intended checks, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `depositTransaction` function, the contract checks if `msg.sender` is equal to `tx.origin` to determine whether the caller is a contract. However, using `tx.origin` can be dangerous, as it allows any contract called by the original contract to bypass this check. The correct approach would be to use `msg.sender`, which represents the direct caller of the function.

## Impact

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can create a malicious contract that calls the `depositTransaction` function and bypasses the intended checks. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential security issues, depending on the specifics of the system, such as the L1-to-L2 address aliasing not being applied correctly.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L395-L436
The vulnerable code snippet is within the `depositTransaction` function:
```solidity
function depositTransaction(
    address _to,
    uint256 _value,
    uint64 _gasLimit,
    bool _isCreation,
    bytes memory _data
)
    public
    payable
    metered(_gasLimit)
{
    // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
    address from = msg.sender;
    if (msg.sender != tx.origin) {
        from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, replace `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` in the `depositTransaction` function to ensure that the direct caller of the function is being considered. This will help prevent potential exploits and ensure the correct behavior of the contract. Here's the updated code snippet:
```solidity
function depositTransaction(
    address _to,
    uint256 _value,
    uint64 _gasLimit,
    bool _isCreation,
    bytes memory _data
)
    public
    payable
    metered(_gasLimit)
{
    // Transform the from-address to its alias if the caller is a contract.
    address from = msg.sender;
    if (msg.sender != msg.sender) { // This condition will always be false, but it's just to illustrate the change.
        from = AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(msg.sender);
    }
    // ... rest of the function
}
```
The updated condition `if (msg.sender != msg.sender)` will always be false, but it's just to illustrate the change. In this case, you may want to remove the condition entirely and always apply the alias transformation to `msg.sender`. However, the specifics of the change will depend on the intended behavior of the contract.
