# Do not use immutable variables and constructors in upgradable contracts

## Summary
Do not use immutable variables and constructors in upgradable contracts
## Vulnerability Detail
### There are two questions, as follows:

1.According to the contract design, DelayedWETH is an upgradeable contract, but the constructor is used in the specific implementation, which is a security risk

  In Solidity, code that is inside a constructor or part of a global variable declaration is not part of a deployed contract’s runtime bytecode. This code is executed only once, when the contract instance is deployed. As a consequence of this, the code within a logic contract’s constructor will never be executed in the context of the proxy’s state. To rephrase, proxies are completely oblivious to the existence of constructors.

2.Upgradable contracts have no constructors, only initializers, so they cannot handle immutable variables.
  Since the immutable variable value is stored in the bytecode its value would be shared among all proxies pointing to a given contract instead of each proxy’s storage.

## Impact
This may cause the contract state to not be properly initialized after updating, causing inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

```solidity
    uint256 internal immutable DELAY_SECONDS;

    /// @notice Address of the SuperchainConfig contract.
    SuperchainConfig public config;

    /// @param _delay The delay for withdrawals in seconds.
    constructor(uint256 _delay) {
        DELAY_SECONDS = _delay;
        initialize({ _owner: address(0), _config: SuperchainConfig(address(0)) });
    }

    /// @notice Initializes the contract.
    /// @param _owner The address of the owner.
    /// @param _config Address of the SuperchainConfig contract.
    function initialize(address _owner, SuperchainConfig _config) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
        config = _config;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.`DELAY_SECONDS` uses constant variables and sets the initial value
It is still ok to define constant state variables, because the compiler [does not reserve a storage slot for these variables](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#constant-state-variables), and every occurrence is replaced by the respective constant
2.To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the `_disableInitializers`function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract
```solidity
   uint256 internal constant DELAY_SECONDS=(Fill in the initial value);

    /// @notice Address of the SuperchainConfig contract.
    SuperchainConfig public config;

    /// @param _delay The delay for withdrawals in seconds.
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();    
    }

    /// @notice Initializes the contract.
    /// @param _owner The address of the owner.
    /// @param _config Address of the SuperchainConfig contract.
    function initialize(address _owner, SuperchainConfig _config) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
        config = _config;
    }
