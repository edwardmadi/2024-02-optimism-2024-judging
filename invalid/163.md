# "Withdrawal Logic issue"

## Summary
  The withdrawal pattern allows for potential griefing where a user can unlock funds but not withdraw them.
## Vulnerability Detail

function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
    @>>    wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
    @>>    wd.amount += _wad;
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IWETH
    function withdraw(uint256 _wad) public override(WETH98, IWETH) {
        withdraw(msg.sender, _wad);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IDelayedWETH
    function withdraw(address _guy, uint256 _wad) public {
        require(!config.paused(), "DelayedWETH: contract is paused");
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        require(wd.amount >= _wad, "DelayedWETH: insufficient unlocked withdrawal");
        require(wd.timestamp > 0, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal not unlocked");
  @>>      require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS <= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
     @>>   wd.amount -= _wad;
        super.withdraw(_wad);
    }
