# Uncontrolled Access to Critical Functions in OptimismPortal2 Contract

## Summary

The OptimismPortal2 smart contract has two external functions, `blacklistDisputeGame` and `setRespectedGameType`, that lack proper access control. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to blacklist dispute games or change the respected game type, disrupting the system's operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `blacklistDisputeGame` and `setRespectedGameType` functions in the OptimismPortal2 contract are marked as `external`, which means they can be called by any external contract or user. However, these functions do not have any access control mechanisms in place, such as the `onlyOwner` or `onlyGuardian` modifiers, to restrict who can call them.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to blacklist dispute games or change the respected game type, potentially disrupting the system's operation or causing other unintended consequences. For instance, an attacker could blacklist a legitimate dispute game, preventing users from finalizing withdrawals. Or, they could change the respected game type to a different game type, potentially affecting the system's security properties.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L440-L452

```solidity
function blacklistDisputeGame(IDisputeGame _disputeGame) external {
    require(msg.sender == guardian(), "OptimismPortal: only the guardian can blacklist dispute games");
    disputeGameBlacklist[_disputeGame] = true;
}

function setRespectedGameType(GameType _gameType) external {
    require(msg.sender == guardian(), "OptimismPortal: only the guardian can set the respected game type");
    respectedGameType = _gameType;
    respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it's recommended to restrict access to the `blacklistDisputeGame` and `setRespectedGameType` functions using the `onlyGuardian` modifier. This ensures that only the guardian can call these functions, preventing unauthorized changes to the system's state.

Here's an example of how you can define the `onlyGuardian` modifier:

```solidity
modifier onlyGuardian() {
    require(msg.sender == guardian(), "Only the guardian can call this function.");
    _;
}
```

Then, you can apply it to the `blacklistDisputeGame` and `setRespectedGameType` functions like this:

```solidity
function blacklistDisputeGame(IDisputeGame _disputeGame) external onlyGuardian {
    disputeGameBlacklist[_disputeGame] = true;
}

function setRespectedGameType(GameType _gameType) external onlyGuardian {
    respectedGameType = _gameType;
    respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
}
```

This way, only the guardian can blacklist dispute games or change the respected game type, preventing unauthorized changes to the system's state.
