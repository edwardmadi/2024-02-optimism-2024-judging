# Insufficient input validation in OptimismPortal2.sol

## Summary

Insufficient input validation

## Vulnerability Detail

The constructor of the OptimismPortal2 contract does not validate its arguments.

## Impact

 This could lead to undesired behavior or potential vulnerabilities depending on how the arguments are used throughout the contract.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L127-L141

```solidity
    constructor(
        uint256 _proofMaturityDelaySeconds,
        uint256 _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds,
        GameType _initialRespectedGameType
    ) {
        PROOF_MATURITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _proofMaturityDelaySeconds;
        DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds;
        respectedGameType = _initialRespectedGameType;

        initialize({
            _disputeGameFactory: DisputeGameFactory(address(0)),
            _systemConfig: SystemConfig(address(0)),
            _superchainConfig: SuperchainConfig(address(0))
        });
    }
```
In this case, the constructor does not validate any of these arguments.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to always validate function arguments, especially in contract constructors. For example:

_proofMaturityDelaySeconds and _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds: These should be validated to ensure they are not excessively large (might cause overflows later in calculation) or excessively small (might lead to blocking withdrawals).

_initialRespectedGameType: Ensure that this is a valid game type (if the type GameType has constraints).

_disputeGameFactory, _systemConfig, and _superchainConfig: Ensure that these are not the zero address and are actually the addresses of deployed contracts.
