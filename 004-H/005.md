# Loss of undistributed bond after the status is changed to DEFENDER_WIN or CHALLANGER_WIN

## Summary

Loss of undistributed bond after the status is changed to DEFENDER_WIN or CHALLANGER_WIN

## Vulnerability Detail

This is the current implementation of the resolveClaim

the user can pass in specific claimIndex

```solidity
 function resolveClaim(uint256 _claimIndex) external payable {
        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the game is currently in progress.
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();

        ClaimData storage parent = claimData[_claimIndex];

        // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve a subgame unless the clock of its root has expired
        uint64 parentClockDuration = parent.clock.duration().raw();
        uint64 timeSinceParentMove = uint64(block.timestamp) - parent.clock.timestamp().raw();
        if (parentClockDuration + timeSinceParentMove <= GAME_DURATION.raw() >> 1) {
            revert ClockNotExpired();
        }

        uint256[] storage challengeIndices = subgames[_claimIndex];
        uint256 challengeIndicesLen = challengeIndices.length;

        // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve subgames twice
        if (_claimIndex == 0 && subgameAtRootResolved) {
            revert ClaimAlreadyResolved();
        }

        // Uncontested claims are resolved implicitly unless they are the root claim. Pay out the bond to the claimant
        // and return early.
        if (challengeIndicesLen == 0 && _claimIndex != 0) {
            // In the event that the parent claim is at the max depth, there will always be 0 subgames. If the
            // `counteredBy` field is set and there are no subgames, this implies that the parent claim was successfully
            // stepped against. In this case, we pay out the bond to the party that stepped against the parent claim.
            // Otherwise, the parent claim is uncontested, and the bond is returned to the claimant.
            address counteredBy = parent.counteredBy;
            address recipient = counteredBy == address(0) ? parent.claimant : counteredBy;
            // @audit subgameAtRootResolved
            _distributeBond(recipient, parent);
            return;
        }
```

As we can see, if the challengeIndicesLen is 0, but the _claimIndex is not 0, 

the bond is distributed, then function returned

otherwise, the code iterate over the challange array, and distribute the bond

in this end, if the claimIndex is 0,

we set the subgameAtRootResolved to True

```solidity
 if (_claimIndex == 0) {
            subgameAtRootResolved = true;
        }
```

after the state subgameAtRootResolved is set to True

anyone can trigger the resolve function to update the status:

```solidity
   function resolve() external returns (GameStatus status_) {
        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the game is currently in progress.
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();

        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the absolute root subgame has been resolved.
        if (!subgameAtRootResolved) revert OutOfOrderResolution();

        // Update the global game status; The dispute has concluded.
        status_ = claimData[0].counteredBy == address(0) ? GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS : GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS;
        resolvedAt = Timestamp.wrap(uint64(block.timestamp));

        // Update the status and emit the resolved event, note that we're performing an assignment here.
        emit Resolved(status = status_);

        // Try to update the anchor state, this should not revert.
        ANCHOR_STATE_REGISTRY.tryUpdateAnchorState();
    }
```

the status is set to either  GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS or GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS

but the problem is that because when resolve claim, the first things checked is the status:

```solidity
function resolveClaim(uint256 _claimIndex) external payable {
    // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the game is currently in progress.
    if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();
```

then after status is set to WIN, no one can trigger resolveClaim, to distribute the bond

```solidity
// Uncontested claims are resolved implicitly unless they are the root claim. Pay out the bond to the claimant
// and return early.
if (challengeIndicesLen == 0 && _claimIndex != 0) {
    // In the event that the parent claim is at the max depth, there will always be 0 subgames. If the
    // `counteredBy` field is set and there are no subgames, this implies that the parent claim was successfully
    // stepped against. In this case, we pay out the bond to the party that stepped against the parent claim.
    // Otherwise, the parent claim is uncontested, and the bond is returned to the claimant.
    address counteredBy = parent.counteredBy;
    address recipient = counteredBy == address(0) ? parent.claimant : counteredBy;
    _distributeBond(recipient, parent);
    return;
}
```

then this part of the undistributed bond is lost.

## Impact

Loss of undistributed bond after the status is changed to DEFENDER_WIN or CHALLANGER_WIN

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider add a function to distribute the bond for specific claim index even after the status changed from IN_PROGESS to DEFENDER_WIN or CHALLANGER_WIN
