# WETH unlock delay will be reset for pending withdrawals for every credit increase.

## Summary

WETH unlock delay will be reset for pending withdrawals for every credit increase.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever user wins a subgame, the bonds will be distributed via `_distributeBond` which calls `WETH.unlock(_recipient, bond)` to with the recipient and amount of bond to unlock

[FaultDisputeGame.sol#L694-L705](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L694-L705)
```solidity
    function _distributeBond(address _recipient, ClaimData storage _bonded) internal {
        // Set all bits in the bond value to indicate that the bond has been paid out.
        uint256 bond = _bonded.bond;
        if (bond == CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG) revert ClaimAlreadyResolved();
        _bonded.bond = CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG;

        // Increase the recipient's credit.
        credit[_recipient] += bond;

        // Unlock the bond.
        WETH.unlock(_recipient, bond);
    }
```

When this occurs, the `wd.timestamp` will be updated to the current time.

[DelayedWETH.sol#L57-L66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L57-L66)
```solidity
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }
```

However, notice that if the user had a previous pending withdrawal, calling this function will essentially reset the withdrawal delay and the user has to wait longer to withdraw the previous pending withdrawal.

## Impact

WETH unlock delay will be reset for pending withdrawals for every credit increase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Should probably store the withdrawal requests in an array for each recipient, so that each withdrawal request can be separated from each other.
