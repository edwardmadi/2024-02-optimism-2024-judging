# `DelayedWETH's` core functionalities(waiting/unlocking/withdrawing) flawly implemented

## Summary
.
## Vulnerability Details

Currently, the assumption on the withdrawal of funds would be `resolveClaim()` gets called, bond gets distributed via `_distributeBond()` which calls the `DelayedWeth::unlock()`, then user waits a while, then they are to now call `claimCredit()`, whose implementation is https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L630-L648

```solidity

    function claimCredit(address _recipient) external {
        // Remove the credit from the recipient prior to performing the external call.
        uint256 recipientCredit = credit[_recipient];
        credit[_recipient] = 0;

        // Revert if the recipient has no credit to claim.
        if (recipientCredit == 0) {
            revert NoCreditToClaim();
        }

        // Try to withdraw the WETH amount so it can be used here.
        WETH.withdraw(_recipient, recipientCredit);

        // Transfer the credit to the recipient.
        (bool success,) = _recipient.call{ value: recipientCredit }(hex"");
        if (!success) revert BondTransferFailed();
    }

```

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L59-L69

```solidity
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }

```

This function unlocks the token, but it's not being protected to ensure that the amount that's been unlocked is less than or equal to the current `deposits` by `msg.sender` in any manner, what this leads to is that anyone can call this function and pass whatever `wad` and `_guy`, i.e `_wad` gets set to `type(uint256).max` and subsequent withdrawals for guy would never need having to wait for `DELAY_SECONDS`.

Now look at this https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L77-L86

```solidity
    function withdraw(address _guy, uint256 _wad) public {
        require(!config.paused(), "DelayedWETH: contract is paused");
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        require(wd.amount >= _wad, "DelayedWETH: insufficient unlocked withdrawal");
        require(wd.timestamp > 0, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal not unlocked");
        require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS <= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
        wd.amount -= _wad;
        super.withdraw(_wad);
    }

```

Having `wd.amount = type(uint256).max` means this can just be set once and then there is no longer a need to update the storage value for `wd` sufficiently sidestepping the subtle invariant of having to wait for `DELAY_SECONDS` for each attempt on withdrawals, note that protocol have stated that it's intentional for other contracts to use `DelayedWETH.sol` and this is case is attached to them, since there's no instance where `wd.amount = type(uint256).max`  can be attached to `FaultDisputeGame.sol`, however for the second case below

Issue is attached to `DELAY_SECONDS`, i.e subsequent calls to `unlock` while withdrawal has not been cleared by the user, resets their timestamp, so they need to wait for `DELAY_SECONDS` again before being able to withdraw, this case however directly has an impact even on [FaultDisputeGame.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L631), since a user that 

Note that from the devs:
> Q: What's a realistic value for DELAY_SECONDS in DelayedWETH.sol?
> A: Realistic value is 7 days


Which means that a user could have to wait for 7 more days if they are to be the recipient of bonds [for subsequent claims being resolved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L405-L478), since while distributing the bonds, `unlock()` is called their `wad` gets incremented, but the timestamp also gets reset to the current `block.timemstamp` causing them to have to wait for a week again, this could go on and on in as much as the user is the recipient for subsequent bonds being distributed.
## Impact

Protocol's core functionality of unlocking/withdrawing is broken as users can not only get griefed, but the whole ideology of delaying the withdrawals can be sidestepped when not used with `FaultDisputeGame.sol` since uint256.max can be passed as `wad` and allow undelayed withdrawals forever.

## Tool Used
Manual review
## Recommendation

Consider tracking each unlock attempt on it's own and not have it reset withdrawal timestamps on consequent calls, additionally consider not allowing more than deposited value to be passed as `wad` for the first case not.
