# Withdrawal Delay Improperly Enforced

## Summary
Improper logic allows withdrawals inside of specified delay period rather than outside

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [contest handbook](https://oplabs.notion.site/Public-OP-Stack-Fault-Proofs-Sherlock-Competition-Handbook-e4cfdf210a5c45c79230af19653163cc), a clause in the **Risks and Mitigation** section of `FaultDisputeGame` states the following:

```text
4. To mitigate bond loss, the contract should ensure that ETH can only leave through the intended claimCredit function. Additionally, the DelayedWETH contract is used to force withdrawal declarations with a delay, allowing time for off-chain review of game results and bond distribution.
```

For a bond to be withdrawn it needs to first be unlocked, and this is done through calls to `_distributeBond()` in `FaultDisputeGame.sol`:

```solidity
function _distributeBond(address _recipient, ClaimData storage _bonded) internal {
        // Set all bits in the bond value to indicate that the bond has been paid out.
        uint256 bond = _bonded.bond;
        if (bond == CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG) revert ClaimAlreadyResolved();
        _bonded.bond = CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG;

        // Increase the recipient's credit.
        credit[_recipient] += bond;

        // Unlock the bond.
        WETH.unlock(_recipient, bond);
    }
```

This function is called in the same `FaultDisputeGame.sol` contract during calls to `resolveClaim()` which resolves a subGame. The WETH contract used is a modified version called `DelayedWETH` which enforces a delay period between the calls to `unlock()` and `withdraw()`. This delay period is needed to create a window for off-chain review of game results and bond distribution. But within the `withdraw()` function of `DelayedWETH` an improper require check is used:

```solidity
require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS <= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
```

This goes against the clause in the `Risks and Mitigations` section of `DelayedWETH` in the contest handbook:

```text
1. The main risk is that the DelayedWETH contract does not function as intended, allowing the FaultDisputeGame contract to withdraw ETH without waiting for the delay period.
2. The FaultDisputeGame contract must integrate with DelayedWETH correctly, ensuring that the withdrawals mapping is a hard accounting method and cannot be bypassed.
```

While this period is measured in seconds, given block times of 13 seconds - there exists a small window which allows a withdrawal to be processed within the delay period instead of after the delay period as specified by the docs.

## Impact
A recipient can claim credit sooner than specified in the documentation.

```solidity
require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS <= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Switch the comparison from `<=` to `>=`

```solidity
require(wd.timestamp + DELAY_SECONDS >= block.timestamp, "DelayedWETH: withdrawal delay not met");
```
