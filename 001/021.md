# Missing Input Validation in DelayedWETH's Unlock Function - Potential Unexpected Behavior

## Summary

Missing input validation in the `unlock` function of the DelayedWETH contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `unlock` function in the DelayedWETH contract does not have any input validation for the `_guy` and `_wad` parameters. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if invalid addresses or large values are passed as arguments.

## Impact

If an invalid address (e.g., the zero address) is passed as the `_guy` parameter, it could lead to unintended behavior or wasted gas when trying to unlock or withdraw funds. If a large value is passed as the `_wad` parameter, it could potentially cause integer overflow or underflow issues in other parts of the contract, depending on how the value is used.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable `unlock` function in the DelayedWETH contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L57-L66
```solidity
function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
    WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
    wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
    wd.amount += _wad;
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent potential unexpected behavior or security issues, consider adding input validation checks in the `unlock` function. Here's an updated version of the `unlock` function with input validation checks:
```solidity
function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
    require(_guy != address(0), "DelayedWETH: invalid address");
    require(_wad > 0, "DelayedWETH: invalid amount");

    WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
    wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
    wd.amount += _wad;
}
```
By adding input validation checks, you can ensure that the contract behaves as expected and minimize the risk of unexpected behavior or potential security issues.
