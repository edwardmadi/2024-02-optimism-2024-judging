# L1 re-orgs could cause `FaultDisputeGame.move()` to be executed on the wrong parent claim

## Summary

Since `FaultDisputeGame.move()` identifies the parent claim by its index in `claimData`, an L1 re-org could cause `move()` to be executed on the wrong parent claim.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `FaultDisputeGame`, when users call `move()` to make a move against a parent claim, they specify `_challengeIndex`, which is the index of the parent claim in the `claimData` array:

[FaultDisputeGame.sol#L226-L231](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L226-L231)

```solidity
    function move(uint256 _challengeIndex, Claim _claim, bool _isAttack) public payable virtual {
        // INVARIANT: Moves cannot be made unless the game is currently in progress.
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();

        // Get the parent. If it does not exist, the call will revert with OOB.
        ClaimData memory parent = claimData[_challengeIndex];
```

Note that the parent claim is only identified by `_challengeIndex`, and nothing else. Claims are pushed to the end of the `claimData` array whenever `move()` is called:

[FaultDisputeGame.sol#L296-L308](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L296-L308)

```solidity
        // Create the new claim.
        claimData.push(
            ClaimData({
                parentIndex: uint32(_challengeIndex),
                // ...
            })
        );
```

Since the parent claim is only identified by `_challengeIndex` when calling `move()`, this makes `move()` vulnerable to L1 re-orgs. More specifically, it is possible for the following to occur:

- Assume the following unfinalized blocks:
  - Block 1: Proposer calls `move()` to submit a claim. Assume this new claim has position 8 and is pushed to `claimData` at index 5.
  - Block 2: Challenger calls `move()` with `_challengeIndex = 5` to dispute the claim at position 8.
  - Block 3: Another party calls `move()` to submit an unrelated claim. Assume this claim has position 12.
- An L1 re-org occurs, placing block 3 before block 1. The new order of execution is:
  - Block 3 is executed. The claim at position 12 is pushed to the `claimData` array first. It ends up at index 5.
  - Block 1 is executed. This pushes the claim at position 8 to `claimData` at index 6.
  - Block 2 is executed, which calls `move()` with `_challengeIndex = 5`. 
- The challenger ends up disputing the claim at position 12, instead of the claim at position 8 that he originally intended to dispute.

As seen from above, an L1 re-org can cause an honest challenger to end up disputing the wrong claim.

## Impact

When an L1 re-org occurs, honest proposers and challengers could end up executing `move()` on the wrong claim. This causes them to lose funds as they end up paying bonds to submit invalid claims, which will then be contested.

Note that if a party's remaining game duration is less than the time it takes for an L1 block to finalize, it will not be possible to wait for the L1 block containing a previous move to finalize. For example:
- Assume `GAME_DURATION` is 8 days, which means each party gets 4 days of game duration.
- If a challenger's previous move has a duration of `4 days - 10 minutes`, he only has 10 minutes to respond to a proposer's claim.
- [It takes ~15 minutes for an L1 block to finalize](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/single-slot-finality/).
- Therefore, since the challenger's remaining duration is less than the time needed for L1 block finality, the challenger cannot wait for the proposer's claim to be included in a finalized L1 block. Otherwise, `move()` will revert as his clock has run out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the parent claim's `claim` and `position` fields as a parameter:

```diff
- function move(uint256 _challengeIndex, Claim _claim, bool _isAttack) public payable virtual {
+ function move(uint256 _challengeIndex, Claim_parentClaim, Position _parentPos, Claim _claim, bool _isAttack) public payable virtual {
```

In `move()`, compare `_parentClaim` and `_parentPos` with the data stored in `claimData[_challengeIndex]`:

```diff
  // Get the parent. If it does not exist, the call will revert with OOB.
  ClaimData memory parent = claimData[_challengeIndex];
+ if (parent.claim.raw() != _parentClaim.raw() || parent.position.raw() != _parentPos.raw()) {
+     revert IncorrectParentClaim();
+ }
```

This ensures that `move()` will never be called on the wrong parent claim.
