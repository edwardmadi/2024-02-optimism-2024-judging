# Claim credits function missing owner check

## Summary

In FaultDisputeGame, `claimCredit(address _recipient)` there is no check if the message sender is the owner of the credits.

## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone is able to call claimCredit with an address they want and cause the credits at that address to be refunded to their owner.

## Impact

Anyone can refund your credits. Though they will not be stolen but returned to the owner, the behavior will not be expected by the credits owner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check `if (!msg.sender == _recipient) revert`
