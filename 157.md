# Blacklisting a malfunctioning game may still prevent reproving ifÂ `status()` reverts

## Summary

In the `OptimismPortal2.proveWithdrawalTransaction`  reproving a withdrawal is allowed if the old dispute game associated with the withdrawal is blacklisted for any reason. However, an external call is made to the blacklisted game's contract, so it is still relied on to function correctly, not reverting, and returning sufficient data. If this call reverts, or its return data does not decode correctly, it can prevent the reproving of the withdrawal. This undermines the safety mechanism provided by the blacklisting functionality.


## Vulnerability Detail

During [the re-proving checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L287-L291) the blacklisted status of the `oldGame` is checked after a call is made to it's `status()` function. As this may revert, either during the external call, or during decoding of the return data, the safety mechanism provided by blacklisting is ineffective.

If a game is blacklisted, it is no longer trusted, and it is possible that the blacklisted implementation may now revert when the `status()` function is called, or not match the interface (e.g., return no data). It is possible that this is what caused the blacklisting of a malfunctioning game in the first place. One possible scenario is if the implementation itself was upgradable, and was incorrectly upgraded. 

## Impact

1. This issue undermines a key safety mechanism, which according to the contest rules is the main focus of the audit:

> In the readme: *"Our primary goal with this particular contest is to gain confidence in the correctness of these safety mechanisms"*

> In the handbook docs: *"care has been taken to create fallbacks and safety nets designed to guarantee safety if these complex components fail. As a result, the only focus of this particular contest is on these safety nets and on the points where the fault proving system integrates with existing smart contracts"*

2. DoS, and breaking core contract functionality due to the user not being able to re-prove their withdrawal despite the old game being blacklisted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


To fix this vulnerability, the `disputeGameBlacklist` should be checked before calling the `status()` function on the old game. This way, even if the blacklisted game's implementation reverts, it won't prevent the reproving of the withdrawal.

```diff
require(  
-    provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS  
-        || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),  
+    provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame]  
+        || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),  
    "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"  
);
```
