# Incorrect Handling of External Call Failures in Withdrawal Finalization

## Summary
The `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function in the `OptimismPortal2` contract has a critical issue where it marks withdrawals as finalized even if the associated external call fails, unless the call is made from a designated gas estimation address. This behavior could lead to funds being irretrievably locked on `L1`, as the contract lacks an on-chain recovery mechanism for such scenarios. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function is designed to execute a withdrawal transaction by making an external call to the target contract specified in the withdrawal data. The success of this external call is critical as it represents the actual transfer of funds or execution of actions on `L1` that were initiated on `L2`.

The function is currently implemented to mark a withdrawal as finalized regardless of the success of the external call, except when the transaction originates from a specific address used for gas estimation (`Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS`). This behavior could lead to a discrepancy between the contract's state and the actual state of user funds, potentially resulting in funds being locked or not correctly processed on `L1`.

## Impact
If the external call fails (which is critical for the withdrawal process), the contract will still mark the withdrawal as finalized. This prevents any further attempts to finalize or correct the withdrawal due to replay protection. Users or off-chain systems have no built-in mechanism to recover from this state, leading to a loss of funds or requiring manual intervention.
### Steps to Reproduce
- Call `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` with a withdrawal transaction that triggers an external call to a contract.
- Ensure the external call fails (e.g., by causing the target contract to revert).
- Observe that the transaction does not revert (unless `tx.origin` is `Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS`), and the withdrawal is marked as finalized in the contract's state. This can be confirmed by checking the `finalizedWithdrawals` mapping, which will return true for the hash of the withdrawal transaction, indicating that the contract considers the withdrawal complete.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `finalizeWithdrawalTransactionExternalProof` function to revert if the external call fails, regardless of the `tx.origin`. This ensures that only successful withdrawals are marked as finalized.
