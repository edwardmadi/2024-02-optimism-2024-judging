# User may never create a dispute game with their desired block hash

## Summary

User may never create a dispute game with their desired block hash

## Vulnerability Detail

when creating a dispute game, the L1 block hash is passed in:

```solidity
bytes32 parentHash = blockhash(block.number - 1);

// Clone the implementation contract and initialize it with the given parameters.
proxy_ = IDisputeGame(address(impl).clone(abi.encodePacked(_rootClaim, parentHash, _extraData)));
proxy_.initialize{ value: msg.value }();
```

But the user cannot determine which block hash that is passed to the dispute game

https://specs.optimism.io/experimental/fault-proof/index.html?highlight=oracle#l1-block-header-blockhash

the l1 block hash is important to authenticate all prior l1 history and is will also be used to derive the l2 block state,

```solidity
function addLocalData(uint256 _ident, uint256 _execLeafIdx, uint256 _partOffset) external {
        // INVARIANT: Local data can only be added if the game is currently in progress.
        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();

        (Claim starting, Position startingPos, Claim disputed, Position disputedPos) =
            _findStartingAndDisputedOutputs(_execLeafIdx);
        Hash uuid = _computeLocalContext(starting, startingPos, disputed, disputedPos);

        IPreimageOracle oracle = VM.oracle();
        if (_ident == LocalPreimageKey.L1_HEAD_HASH) {
            // Load the L1 head hash
            
            oracle.loadLocalData(_ident, uuid.raw(), l1Head().raw(), 32, _partOffset);
        }
```

user may expect the block hash is x, 

while because of the blockchain reorg or pending transaction period or even the malicious validator manipulate the block hash value so a invalid l2 state can be derived,

the block hash is y, when the transaction is executed and landed and dispute game is created

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the recommendation is when creating a dispute game, pass the block number and block hash in 

```solidity
 function create(
        GameType _gameType,
        Claim _rootClaim,
        uint256 block_hash,
        uint256 block_number,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    )
        external
        payable
        returns (IDisputeGame proxy_)
    {
```

in this way, the user can explicitly control which block hash to use when create dispute game

Please note, the blockHash opcode can only query the recent 256 block hash,

otherwise calling blockHash(block_number - 256) would return bytes32(0)

but there should be off-chain service to retrieve a block hash or a certain block.

It would requires active monitor to monitor that the block hash added is valid and additional penalty / blocklisting can be implemented to prevent an attempt to input a invalid block hash.

Suppose in the worst case, malicious validator can manipulate block hash, we should treat this block hash as a untrusted parameter instead of deterministically put in the block hash data when dispute game is created.

```solidity
bytes32 parentHash = blockhash(block.number - 1);

// Clone the implementation contract and initialize it with the given parameters.
proxy_ = IDisputeGame(address(impl).clone(abi.encodePacked(_rootClaim, parentHash, _extraData)));
proxy_.initialize{ value: msg.value }();
```
