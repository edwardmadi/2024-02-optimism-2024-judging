# Precision loss in computation of  the `requiredGas` and hence `requiredBond_`

## Summary
The precision loss in the calculation of `requiredBond_` due to division before multiplication in computation of `lnA`.
The actual result of the multiplication might be slightly off due to truncation or rounding errors in the prior division.

## Vulnerability Detail
The worst-case scenario for precision loss occurs in the computation of `requiredGas` due to the division before multiplication. In Solidity, when you perform division before multiplication, the result of the division is truncated to the nearest lower integer, which can lead to precision loss. 

For example, if `a` were calculated as `0.09999999999999999` instead of `0.1` due to the division operation, and this value were used in the calculation of `lnA` and hence `numerator`, the result would be slightly less than expected due to the truncation. This precision loss can accumulate through the subsequent calculations, leading to an inaccurate `requiredGas` and, consequently, an inaccurate `requiredBond_`.

## Impact
The precision loss can manifest in the calculation of `requiredBond_` due to the division before multiplication in the computation of numerator. For example, if `lnA` is not correctly scaled or if there's a loss of precision in the division before multiplication, this can lead to inaccuracies in the final result.

## Recommendation
 It's crucial to ensure that calculations involving division are performed with sufficient precision and that the order of operations is carefully considered to minimize the impact of truncation
