# `respectedGameType` is set in the constructor and not in the initializer function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L127C11-L162C6

## Summary

the `GameType public respectedGameType` variable in the `OptimismPortal2.sol` is set in the constructor, because it is a base contract that will be deployed behind a proxy, the proxy might have another value stored in the `respectedGameType` slot, or it might be empty.

## Vulnerability Detail

because of this, the value the deployer expects will be the `respectedGameType` will be different because it is set in the base contract and not in the proxy contract.

## Impact

if the `GameType` at the respectedGameType` slot is vulnerable, an attacker can use that to target portals before this value is reset.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

set the `GameType respectedGameType` in the `function initialize` instead of the `constructor`.
