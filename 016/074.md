# Lack of Synchronization Between Withdrawal and Transfer Functions Leads to Potential Double-Spending

## Summary
In the provided Solidity contract, specifically within the `withdraw` and `transferFrom` functions, there exists a lack of synchronization that can lead to a potential double-spending issue. Let's delve into the code snippets to understand the vulnerability more clearly.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided contract, the vulnerability stems from the fact that the `withdraw` function, when called, subtracts the withdrawal amount (`wad`) directly from the `balanceOf` the sender before transferring the corresponding WETH tokens using the `transfer` function, which internally calls the `transferFrom` function.
Here's the relevant portion of the `withdraw` function:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 wad) public virtual {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad); // Check if sender has enough balance
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad; // Subtract the withdrawal amount from sender's balance
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad); // Transfer Ether to the sender
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
}
```
And here's the relevant portion of the `transfer` function (which, as mention before , eventually calls `transferFrom`):

```solidity
function transfer(address dst, uint256 wad) external returns (bool) {
    return transferFrom(msg.sender, dst, wad); // Calls transferFrom
}
```
And finally, the vulnerable part is in the `transferFrom` function:
```solidity
function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 wad) public returns (bool) {
    require(balanceOf[src] >= wad); // Check if src has enough balance

    // Check and update allowance
    if (src != msg.sender && allowance[src][msg.sender] != type(uint256).max) {
        require(allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad);
        allowance[src][msg.sender] -= wad;
    }

    balanceOf[src] -= wad; // Subtract wad from src's balance
    balanceOf[dst] += wad; // Add wad to dst's balance

    emit Transfer(src, dst, wad); // Emit Transfer event

    return true;
}
```
The issue arises when a malicious user calls `withdraw` with a `wad` amount higher than their balance, then immediately transfers WETH tokens to another address before the balance deduction is reflected in the contract state. This allows the user to double-spend the tokens because the `transferFrom` function once again subtracts `wad` from the sender's balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 wad) public virtual {
    // Check if sender has enough balance
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad, "Insufficient balance");

    // Update contract state
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;

    // Interact with external contract (transfer Ether)
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: wad}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");

    // Emit event
    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
}
```
