# The protocol doesn't check at all if account has already claimed, or moved (for attack, and defense).

## Summary
`move` function in `FaultDisputeGame` contract doesn't check if account is already the claimant of parent claim.

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious actor create multiple defends or attacks for a game.
An account can create a defend and attack claim simultaneously for parent claim, so subgames can come from an account in a claim.
In addition, an account can have multiple defends for his root claim.

Indeed, creating claim for depend and attack doesn't check if msg.sender is related to claimant of parent claim and opposite claim.

## Impact
It impacts fair claim.
