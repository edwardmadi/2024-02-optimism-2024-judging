# It is possible for an earlier claim to resolve before a later one

## Summary

When resolving claims, the claim at the granular level (at MAX_DEPTH) is resolved first and will perforate upwards until all the claims are resolved. It is possible that an earlier claim can be resolved before a later claim.

## Vulnerability Detail

In every subgame apart from the root, there can be an attack and defense claim. Imagine there are 8 claims: This is how the claim is played out. The first claim is the root claim. The second claim is an attack of the root claim. The third and fourth claim is an attack and defence of the second claim respectively. The fifth and sixth claim is the attack and defense of the third attack claim.

claimData[0] = rootClaim
claimData[1] = Attack claim, subgame[0] = [1]
claimData[2] = Attack claim against claimData[1], subgame[1] = [2]
claimData[3] = Defense claim for claimData[1], subgame[1] =  [2,3]
claimData[4] = Attack claim against claimData[2], subgame[2] = [4]
claimData[5] = Defense claim for claimData[2], subgame[2] = [4,5]
claimData[6] = Attack claim against claimData[3], subgame[3] = [6]
claimData[7] = Defense claim against claimData[3], subgame[3] = [6,7]

There are 8 claims with 4 subgames.

When it comes to resolveClaims(), the later claims should be resolved first. In other words, claimData[1] cannot be resolved unless the other claims have been resolved.

Looking at the resolveClaim() function, it does check that the earlier claims must be resolved first. However, this check does not hold for subgames with both attack and defense claims.

```solidity
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < challengeIndicesLen; ++i) {
            uint256 challengeIndex = challengeIndices[i];

>           // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve a subgame containing an unresolved claim
>           if (subgames[challengeIndex].length != 0) revert OutOfOrderResolution();

            ClaimData storage claim = claimData[challengeIndex];

            // If the child subgame is uncountered and further left than the current left-most counter,
            // update the parent subgame's `countered` address and the current `leftmostCounter`.
            // The left-most correct counter is preferred in bond payouts in order to discourage attackers
            // from countering invalid subgame roots via an invalid defense position. As such positions
            // cannot be correctly countered.
            // Note that correctly positioned defense, but invalid claimes can still be successfully countered.
            if (claim.counteredBy == address(0) && leftmostCounter.raw() > claim.position.raw()) {
                countered = claim.claimant;
                leftmostCounter = claim.position;
            }
        }
```

Instead of resolving subgames[3], a player decides to resolve subgames[2] first. Since there are no subgames[4] and subgames[5], subgames[2] is able to resolve before subgames[3]

```solidity
    uint256[] storage challengeIndices = subgames[_claimIndex];
        uint256 challengeIndicesLen = challengeIndices.length;
```

- claimIndex = 2
- challengeIndices = subgames[2] = [4,5]
- challengeIndicesLen = 2

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < challengeIndicesLen; ++i) {
            uint256 challengeIndex = challengeIndices[i];

            // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve a subgame containing an unresolved claim
            if (subgames[challengeIndex].length != 0) revert OutOfOrderResolution();
```
```solidity
- challengeIndex = challengeIndices[0] = 4
- if (subgames[4].length != 0) revert (doesn't revert as the length of subgames[4] is 0.
- The function continues and ` delete subgames[_claimIndex]` is called
```

subgame[2] is resolved before subgame[3].

## Impact

Breaks the invariant that the later claims must be resolved before the earlier ones

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Not sure if intended or not, but with only one `move()` per subgame, later claims will never be able to resolve before earlier ones.
