# DelayedWETH unlocking may lead to DoS / perpetual locking of funds

## Summary

When [unlocking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L57-L66) funds in the `DelayedWETH` contract, the timestamp is updated for both newly and previously unlocked amounts. This may lead to DoS, when the funds, being gradually unlocked, will stay permanently unaccessible.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Unlocking in DelayedWETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L57-L66) looks as follows:

```solidity
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }
```
Notice that `wd.amount` may hold the funds that have been unlocked previously, at much earlier time point. Nevertheless, when new funds are being unlocked, the new timestamp is updated uniformly both for the previously as well as for the newly unlocked funds. Combined with the necessity to wait for `DELAY_SECONDS` before the funds can be withdrawn, this may lead to DoS, when the new funds are being unlocked in small portions right before `DELAY_SECONDS` expires, leading to all funds being unavailable for withdraw perpetually.

## Impact

Possible DoS, leading to permanent locking of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend to store in `withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy]` not the single WithdrawalRequest, but an array of them. In that way each withdrawal request will have its individual timestamp, and all requests can be processed individually.
