# New unlock will prevent users from withdrawing assets they should be able to withdraw

## Summary
When the [unlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L704) function is run twice, [wd.timestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L64C9-L64C40) is updated again, which prevents users from withdrawing assets they should be able to withdraw, again extending the lock time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The user may receive multiple [distributions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol#L694-L705) in a Game, which will result in multiple unlocks. If the user has not withdrawn the previously unlocked assets, the new unlock will extend the locking time of the previously unlocked assets.
```solidity
    function _distributeBond(address _recipient, ClaimData storage _bonded) internal {
        // Set all bits in the bond value to indicate that the bond has been paid out.
        uint256 bond = _bonded.bond;
        if (bond == CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG) revert ClaimAlreadyResolved();
        _bonded.bond = CLAIMED_BOND_FLAG;

        // Increase the recipient's credit.
        credit[_recipient] += bond;

        // Unlock the bond.
        WETH.unlock(_recipient, bond);
    }
```

```solidity
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }
```

## Impact
User's assets may be locked for longer periods of time.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function unlock(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        // Note that the unlock function can be called by any address, but the actual unlocking capability still only
        // gives the msg.sender the ability to withdraw from the account. As long as the unlock and withdraw functions
        // are called with the proper recipient addresses, this will be safe. Could be made safer by having external
        // accounts execute withdrawals themselves but that would have added extra complexity and made DelayedWETH a
        // leaky abstraction, so we chose this instead.
        WithdrawalRequest storage wd = withdrawals[msg.sender][_guy];
        wd.timestamp = block.timestamp;
        wd.amount += _wad;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that different bonds record different locking times.
