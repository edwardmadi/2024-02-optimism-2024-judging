# DelayedWETH.DELAY_SECONDS could be bypassed by calling resolve a long time after unlocking

## Summary
DelayedWETH.DELAY_SECONDS is an airgap that's used to freeze assets incase there's mistake in `resolve`. But tokens are unlocked before `resolve` and there's no enforcement in the codebase to `resolve` immediately after unlock.


## Vulnerability Detail
After `resolveClaim` has been called for all claimIndex, all tokens would be unlocked. However, the game has not resolve unless, `resolve` is called to change the game status. This could be used to bypass the delay airgap.


### PoC
* start a game that would resolve in a wrong status
* `resolveClaim` for all claimIndex
* wait till DELAY_SECONDS has passed
* `claimCredit` to withdraw ETH
* finally `resolve` the game


## Impact
An attacker could bypass the DELAY_SECONDS and claim ETH for a wrongly resolved game.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
You could add the airgap to the dispute game and start counting after `resolve` has been called and status has been updated. Or you could call `resolve` when `resolveClaim` for index zero is called.
