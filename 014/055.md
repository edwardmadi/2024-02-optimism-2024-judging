# Dispute game factory cannot be initialized

## Summary
Initializing of dispute game factory will likely to fail 
## Vulnerability Detail
    constructor() OwnableUpgradeable() {
        initialize(address(0));
       }
    function initialize(address _owner) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }

 In openzepplin contract, if there 's initializing __Ownable_init with address 0 there will be reverted 

      function __Ownable_init(address initialOwner) internal onlyInitializing {
        __Ownable_init_unchained(initialOwner);
    }

    function __Ownable_init_unchained(address initialOwner) internal onlyInitializing {
        if (initialOwner == address(0)) {
            revert OwnableInvalidOwner(address(0));
        }
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
//openzepplin contract

Protocol call ownable_init with empty calldata , that means it will be called with address 0 .This may lead to revert

## Impact
Initializing will fail

## Recommendation
ownable_init with address owner
