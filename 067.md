# Functions returning `true` without their success checked may result in inconsistencies.

## Summary
Functions should return a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded. They are expected to return `true` if the operations are successful and `false` otherwise. 
However, the `approve()` and `transferFrom()` functions in `WETH98.sol` do not perform this check and simply returns `true` after attempting the operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
##### Scenario:

- `Alice` holds some ETH  and wants to transfer them to `Bob`.
- `Alice` invokes the `approve()` function to allow a smart contract Exchange to spend a certain amount of her `ETH` .
However, the `approve()` function fails  due to an out-of-gas error or other unexpected issue.
- Despite the failure of the approval operation, the `approve()` function returns `true` indicating success.
- Now, the Exchange contract attempts to execute a `transferFrom()` operation to transfer ETH tokens from `Alice` to `Bob` based on the incorrect allowance.
- Since the `allowance` was not set correctly due to the previous issue, the `transferFrom()` operation fails, but the function still returns `true` indicating success.
- As a result, `Bob` doesn't receive the expected ETH tokens, and `Alice`'s tokens remain in her possession.

## Impact
This discrepancy between the `expected behavior` and the `actual behavior` could cause issues in areas that rely on the these functions to accurately report the success or failure of a their respective operation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
These  functions should be modified to check the `success` of their operations and return the appropriate boolean value.
