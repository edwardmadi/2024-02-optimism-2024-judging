# Mulptile dispute game may leads to race condition and lack of input validation from l2 block number

## Summary

Mulptile dispute game may leads to race condition and lack of input validation from l2 block number

## Vulnerability Detail

There can be multiple dispute game,

```solidity
// Grab the latest anchor root.
(Hash root, uint256 rootBlockNumber) = ANCHOR_STATE_REGISTRY.anchors(GAME_TYPE);

// Should only happen if this is a new game type that hasn't been set up yet.
if (root.raw() == bytes32(0)) revert AnchorRootNotFound();

// Set the starting output root.
startingOutputRoot = OutputRoot({ l2BlockNumber: rootBlockNumber, root: root });

// Do not allow the game to be initialized if the root claim corresponds to a block at or before the
// configured starting block number.
if (l2BlockNumber() <= rootBlockNumber) revert UnexpectedRootClaim(rootClaim());
```

When creating a dispute game, the only requires is that the l2 block that passed is greater than the anchored L2 block

suppose anchor state l2 block is at 500

suppose game A pass in a claim hash and paired with block number 1000

suppose game B pass in a claim hash and paired with block number 1002

and game B resolved incorrectly first

the audit is under the assupmtion that the game can be resolved incorrectly

> FaultDisputeGame resolution logic is not included in the scope of this contest. Participants should assume that the FaultDisputeGame can resolve incorrectly (i.e.g, can resolve to DEFENDER_WINS when it should resolve to CHALLENGER_WINS or vice versa).

but the problem is that because the l2 block number of Game B is greater than game A,

and the game B's claim root and block number will be written to the anchor state:

```solidity
// No need to update anything if the anchor state is already newer.
if (game.l2BlockNumber() <= anchors[gameType].l2BlockNumber) {
    return;
}

// Must be a game that resolved in favor of the state.
if (game.status() != GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS) {
    return;
}

// Actually update the anchor state.
anchors[gameType] = OutputRoot({ l2BlockNumber: game.l2BlockNumber(), root: Hash.wrap(game.rootClaim().raw()) });
```

then even when the game A's claim is resolved correctly, the correct claim root will not be written to the anchor state because

the block number of the game A is 1000 < 1002

```solidity
// No need to update anything if the anchor state is already newer.
if (game.l2BlockNumber() <= anchors[gameType].l2BlockNumber) {
    return;
}
```

this cause valid withdrawals to not be finalizable

> there should be no function that can cause valid withdrawals to not be finalizable (at most Medium)

In the worst case, a malicious user can create a dispute game with a l2 block from that is that far from the current l2 block

then after that game is resolved, all valid withdraw may not be executable,

combing with the fact that user can pass in any l2 block number via the extraData field

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

validate that the passed in l2 block number is not too far awayr from the future and also introduce a mechanism to replace / overwrite the output root even

when the correpsonding l2 block number is small
