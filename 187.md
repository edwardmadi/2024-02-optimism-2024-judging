# No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contracts

## Summary
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.

Refer to the bottom part of this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

## Vulnerability Detail
[DelayedWETH.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L22) is an upgradeable contract and inherits from `WETH98`, and at the same time, there are [storage variables](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/WETH98.sol#L31-L32) defined in [WETH98](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/WETH98.sol#L26)
```
 31     mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
 32     mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;
```

So storage gap should be included
