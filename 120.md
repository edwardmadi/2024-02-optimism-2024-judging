# If a subgame has both attack and defend claims and the challenger loses, the defender of the challenger should not be able to get his bond back

## Summary

The defender of the challenger still gets his money back when he is not supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail

There can exist both an attack an defend move on a subgame. Let's say there is both an attack and defend on the same subgame. There are three actors in the game, Alice, Bob and Charlie. Alice is the one that proposes the root Claim, and Bob attacks the root claim. The root claim can only be attacked and not defended. Alice then attacks Bob's claim and a third party Charlie defends Bob's claim. The game ends here due to time constraint / other reasons.

Alice = claimData[0] - root Claim
Bob = claimData[1] - First attack claim, challengeIndex of 0, with subgame[0] = [1] (cannot have a defend claim against the root claim)
Alice = claimData[2] - Second attack claim, challengeIndex of 1, with subgame[1] = [2]
Charlie = claimData[3] - Third defend claim, challengeIndex of 1, with subgame[1] = [2,3]

There are 4 claims, with 3 subgames (1 root at depth = 1, 1 subgame at depth = 2, 2 subgames at depth = 3)

If the game ends here, it means that Alice won, because there is no one that countered her second attack claim. Charlie should be penalized because he tried to defend Bob but Bob is not correct.

However, Charlie is able to get his bond back.

Charlie calls resolveClaim() with an index of 3 (his claim). 

- challengeIndices = subgames[3]
- challengeIndices = []
- challengeIndicesLen = 0

```solidity
 uint256[] storage challengeIndices = subgames[_claimIndex];
        uint256 challengeIndicesLen = challengeIndices.length;

        // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve subgames twice
        if (_claimIndex == 0 && subgameAtRootResolved) {
            revert ClaimAlreadyResolved();
        }

        // Uncontested claims are resolved implicitly unless they are the root claim. Pay out the bond to the claimant
        // and return early.
>       if (challengeIndicesLen == 0 && _claimIndex != 0) {
            // In the event that the parent claim is at the max depth, there will always be 0 subgames. If the
            // `counteredBy` field is set and there are no subgames, this implies that the parent claim was successfully
            // stepped against. In this case, we pay out the bond to the party that stepped against the parent claim.
            // Otherwise, the parent claim is uncontested, and the bond is returned to the claimant.
            address counteredBy = parent.counteredBy;
            address recipient = counteredBy == address(0) ? parent.claimant : counteredBy;
            _distributeBond(recipient, parent);
            return;
        }
```

Charlie gets his bond back.

## Impact

The defender should not be able to get back his funds if he is defending the wrong claim.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Not sure about the recommendation as it is quite hard to track if the game does not end on the granula execution level.
