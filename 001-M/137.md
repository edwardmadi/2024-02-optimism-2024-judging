# respectedGameType initialized in constructor, not in initializer function

## Summary
The initial respectedGameType is set in constructor, not in initializer, thus it will be set in the implementation contract, not the proxy. Thus it will be set to address(0) initially and until it is set again using setRespectedGameType().

## Vulnerability Detail
When using proxy pattern, it is important to initialize storage variables in the initializer, not in the constructor. This is because the constructor is only invoked in the context of the implementation contract, while the initializer will be used to set the variables in the proxy. Setting immutables is fine in the constructor, since they are replaced on every place they are used by a constant and are not actually part of the storage. In this case, this is not followed for the respectedGameType. In the code snipped below it is visible that it is in fact initialized in the constructor.

## Impact
Initial value of respectedGameType in the proxy will be address(0)

## Code Snippet
Constructor setting the initial value of the several fields, 2 immutables, which are fine and 1 which is problematic, the respectedGameType:

```js
    constructor(
        uint256 _proofMaturityDelaySeconds,
        uint256 _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds,
        GameType _initialRespectedGameType
    ) {
        PROOF_MATURITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _proofMaturityDelaySeconds;
        DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds;
        respectedGameType = _initialRespectedGameType; // @audit this should be set in initializer

        initialize({
            _disputeGameFactory: DisputeGameFactory(address(0)),
            _systemConfig: SystemConfig(address(0)),
            _superchainConfig: SuperchainConfig(address(0))
        });
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set respectedGameType in initializer instead.
