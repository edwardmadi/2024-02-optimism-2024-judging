# OptimismPortal2's respectedGameType property is not initialized

## Summary

The `respectedGameType` property of the `OptimismPortal2` contract is set within the constructor. This implies that it will be initialized in the implementation storage, leaving the proxy storage unaffected.

## Vulnerability Detail

`OptimismPortal2` is a new impelementaion of existing version of the contract `OptimismPortal` (upgradeble [proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbEb5Fc579115071764c7423A4f12eDde41f106Ed)).

Three parameters are passed to the constructor of the `OptimismPortal2` contract.

```solidity
constructor(
    uint256 _proofMaturityDelaySeconds,
    uint256 _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds,
    GameType _initialRespectedGameType
) {
    PROOF_MATURITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _proofMaturityDelaySeconds;
    DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS = _disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds;
    respectedGameType = _initialRespectedGameType;

    initialize({
        _disputeGameFactory: DisputeGameFactory(address(0)),
        _systemConfig: SystemConfig(address(0)),
        _superchainConfig: SuperchainConfig(address(0))
    });
}
```

Unlike the first two parameters, which are immutable, `respectedGameType` is a storage property. Consequently, when the implementation contract is deployed, the value passed to the constructor updates the implementation storage. However, in the proxy, this property remains uninitialized.

## Impact

In the proxy contract, the `respectedGameType` property remains uninitialized. This means that transactions will not be able to be finalized using the results of dispute games created at this time. After a guardian sets `respectedGameType`, the `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` will also be updated.

```solidity
function setRespectedGameType(GameType _gameType) external {
    require(msg.sender == guardian(), "OptimismPortal: only the guardian can set the respected game type");
    respectedGameType = _gameType;
    respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
}
```

The results of all dispute games created before this update will not be valid.

```solidity
function checkWithdrawal(bytes32 _withdrawalHash, address _proofSubmitter) public view {
    ...
    require(
        createdAt >= respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt,
        "OptimismPortal: dispute game created before respected game type was updated"
    );
    ...
}
```

## Recommendation

Move `respectedGameType` to the `initialize` function.
