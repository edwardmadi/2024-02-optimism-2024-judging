# Users transactions may become stuck after gameType upgrades

## Summary
If the game type of the portal changes to the same game type, all prior proven transactions can't be  reproven or executed.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`OptimismPortal2.checkWithdrawal()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/f216b0d3ad08c1a0ead557ea74691aaefd5fd489/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L504-L507) deems a transaction valid only if the associated game is created after the portal's game type has been upgraded.

```solidity
        require(
            createdAt >= respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt,
            "OptimismPortal: dispute game created before respected game type was updated"
        );
```

If the game type is changed from type X to type X again, all proven transactions will become invalid. Realistically, a direct change from type X to type X will probably not happen. However, it's possible for the portal to change the type from X to Y and then to X again before the execution of a proven transaction.

In this scenario, the given proven transaction can't be reproven because of the following require statement

```solidity
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS
                || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"
        );
```

Here, the game type will still be the same as the portal's current one and `proveWithdrawalTransaction()` will revert.



## Impact
Medium, as it requires two type changes in the interval `[PROVING; EXECUTING]`. The minimum time difference between proving and executing will be 7 days, but there is no maximum, so there is no guarantee that the two changes must happen in 7 days.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setRespectedGameType(GameType _gameType) external {
        require(msg.sender == guardian(), "OptimismPortal: only the guardian can set the respected game type");
        respectedGameType = _gameType;
        respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow reproving of the transaction if the associated game has been created before the portal type update.

```diff
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS
                || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),
+             || oldGame.createdAt().raw() < respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"
        );
```
