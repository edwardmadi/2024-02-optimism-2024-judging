# Proven but not finalized withdrawals need to be re-proved when a new respected game type is changed

## Summary

When the guardian changes the respected game type - proven withdrawals that used that game type will need to re-prove their withdrawal leading to an additional 7 day delay. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The guardian will change the respected game type when the blacklisting function would have to be used over and over again.

Changing the respected game type updates `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L451
```solidity
    function setRespectedGameType(GameType _gameType) external {
        require(msg.sender == guardian(), "OptimismPortal: only the guardian can set the respected game type");
        respectedGameType = _gameType;
        respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt = uint64(block.timestamp);
    }
``` 

However - when finalizing a withdrawal, there is check to validate that `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` is not after the proven withdrawal `createdAt`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L504
```solidity
        require(
            createdAt >= respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt,
            "OptimismPortal: dispute game created before respected game type was updated"
        );
```

If not all games are directly effected from the bug (there could be some honest, legit resolved games) then the user will need to prove their withdrawal again and wait the 7 day waiting period.

## Impact

Delay of withdrawals.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a guardian function that can "whitelist" specific games and don't revert when the respected game changed if the game is whitelisted.
