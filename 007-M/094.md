# Update on `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` will make withdrawal not reprovable due to incorrect check

## Summary

A `proven` withdrawal is not `finalizeable` if `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` is updated to be after it's creation.

For valid, `proven` withdrawal in which the `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` is updated (for example to ensure that all new games are after time X), the user will be unable to re-prove them as the require will fail due to ignoring this additional possibility

```solidity
        IDisputeGame oldGame = provenWithdrawal.disputeGameProxy;
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS
                || disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw(),
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"
        ); /// @audit If the timestamp for respected game is updated, then a withdrawal cannot be proven, so it will not be reprovable by the addy
```

## Vulnerability Detail

Guardian can reset `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` for a variety of reasons
One of them would be to invalidate previous games and prevent them from being `finalized`

In those scenarios, a withdrawal that was already `proven` will not be re-provable and that `proven` withdrawal, which may have resulted in `DEFENDER_WINS` will not be `finalizeable` per this check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L497-L507

```solidity
        // The game type of the dispute game must be the respected game type. This was also checked in
        // `proveWithdrawalTransaction`, but we check it again in case the respected game type has changed since
        // the withdrawal was proven. | /// @audit OP Only uses one game type at a time
        require(disputeGameProxy.gameType().raw() == respectedGameType.raw(), "OptimismPortal: invalid game type");

        // The game must have been created after `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`. This is to prevent users from creating
        // invalid disputes against a deployed game type while the off-chain challenge agents are not watching.
        require(
            createdAt >= respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt, /// @audit This means it will not allow the re-proving
            "OptimismPortal: dispute game created before respected game type was updated"
        );
```

## Impact

For those games, a new address will need to be used, the `msg.sender` will be unable to prove the withdrawal again and the proven withdrawal will not be `finalizeable`

As discussed in the scope and in the onboarding call, the goal of this exercise is to verify the validity of failsafes, the inability to re-prove a valid withdrawal due to a race condition is an example of the failsafes creating a risky edge case.

## Code Snippet

There are 2 scenarios in which this issue can happen:

Scenario 1: Admin Privilege in emergency

- User Proves their Withdrawal
- Guardian has to delay the validation of games, and decides to re-set the `respectedGameType` to be the same value, which will update `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt` to be the current timestamp
- User is unable to Finalize, and unable to Prove their Withdrawal

Scenario 2: User gets rekt due to race condition

- User goes to Factory and deploys the latest game type
- Guardian sets the respected game type after this due to a race condition or an admin mistake
- User is able to prove their withdrawal
- User is unable to finalize it, their withdrawal is lost unless all other withdrawals are invalidated by changing the `respectedGameType`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Updated the check to:

```solidity
        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 || 
            oldGame.status() == GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS || 
            disputeGameBlacklist[oldGame] || 
            oldGame.gameType().raw() != respectedGameType.raw() ||
            (oldGame.status() == GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS && oldGame.createdAt < respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt), /// @audit Allow re-proving if the old game is valid, but the createdAt is less than `respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt`
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven, and the old dispute game is not invalid"
        );
```
