# Malicious users can bypass Optimism's air-gaps by manipulating Immutable arguments in their fault dispute game proxies.

## Summary
On the creation of a new fault dispute game contract, the factory calls the clone() function in the cwia library to create a new proxy contract with the claim details, the issue is that when cloning proxies with immutable arguments, the user can configure certain immutable arguments in their game proxy allowing for them to bypass certain checks, an example being the unlock period users are supposed to wait before they can withdraw their bonds which were previously locked in the weth98 contract, this is only one attack vector and other vectors can arise with such a feature.
## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a new dispute game contract at the line 106:

```solidity
084:    function create(
085:        GameType _gameType,
086:       Claim _rootClaim,
087:        bytes calldata _extraData
088:    )
089:        external
090:       payable
091:       returns (IDisputeGame proxy_)
092:    {
..SNIP..
102:        // Get the hash of the parent block.
103:       bytes32 parentHash = blockhash(block.number - 1);
104:
105:       // Clone the implementation contract and initialize it with the given parameters.
106:        proxy_ = IDisputeGame(address(impl).clone(abi.encodePacked(_rootClaim, parentHash, _extraData)));
107:       proxy_.initialize{ value: msg.value }();
..SNIP..
122:   }
```

It creates the proxy on the call to ClonesWithImmutableArgs::clone(), the issue that arises here is that the packed data 
 including the _extraData that is forwarded to the function's parameter is arbitrary, as the value is specified by the user.

> ClonesWithImmutableArgs.sol is a proxy pattern that allows users to create clone contracts with personalized immutable arguments. The immutable arguments are stored in the code region of the created proxy contract. When the proxy is called, it reads the arguments into memory. 

so even though the implementation contract has immutable variables, on the call to create proxies pointing to the implementation, the immutable variables in the proxy can be made to be different from the one in the implementation.

```solidity

    /// @dev data cannot exceed 65535 bytes, since 2 bytes are used to store the data length
    /// @param implementation The implementation contract to clone
    /// @param data Encoded immutable args
    /// @param value The amount of wei to transfer to the created clone
    /// @return instance The address of the created clone
    function clone(
        address implementation,
        bytes memory data,
        uint256 value
    ) internal returns (address payable instance) {
        bytes memory creationcode = getCreationBytecode(implementation, data);
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            instance := create(
                value,
                add(creationcode, 0x20),
                mload(creationcode)
            )
        }
        if (instance == address(0)) {
            revert CreateFail();
        }
    }
```
On the call to getCreationBytecode() which includes the implementation and the data:
https://github.com/wighawag/clones-with-immutable-args/blob/2df4bff4eef8c061b9a92a7edbbfe12dbf6bcdb0/src/ClonesWithImmutableArgs.sol#L133C1-L265C6

```solidity
    /// @notice Computes bytecode for a clone
    /// @dev data cannot exceed 65535 bytes, since 2 bytes are used to store the data length
    /// @param implementation The implementation contract to clone
    /// @param data Encoded immutable args
    /// @return ret Creation bytecode for the clone contract
    function getCreationBytecode(
        address implementation,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal pure returns (bytes memory ret) {
        // unrealistic for memory ptr or data length to exceed 256 bits
..SNIP..
}
```
The function gets the proxy bytecode to be used for creation, it does this via assembly simply by adding the immutable arguments and appending a delegation to the implementation contract since the _extraData we saw previously is user-specified a malicious user can add data to set at least one immutable variable to a variable of their choice, and can use this in a way beneficial to them at the same time bypassing Optimism airgaps which can lead to a security breach.

**Example of an attack.**

- Malicious user creates their delayedWeth contract with the same functions but a different logic, manipulating the delayed period, allowing the DELAY_SECONDS to be zero, and setting himself as the owner.
- Malicious user create their proxy via the factory, with data to reconfigure the immutable WETH variable to their own delayed WETH contract in their proxy.
- On the call to initialize the bond is set to the WETH contract which is controlled by the user, allowing the user to play the fault dispute game knowing the funds are in his control and can grieve anyone that challenges their claim.


## Impact
Users can bypass certain checks like the unlock period and possibly configure their game proxies to read incorrect values from malicious immutable variables

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
make the _extraData deterministic or remove it completely.
