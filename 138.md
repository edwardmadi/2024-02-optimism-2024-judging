# Approve/TransferFrom Race Condition in WETH98 Contract

## Summary
The `WETH98` contract, which implements a Wrapped Ether (WETH) token, is susceptible to a race condition between the `approve()` and `transferFrom()` functions. This race condition arises due to the asynchronous nature of blockchain transactions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior during token transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `WETH98` contract, the `approve()` function allows a token holder to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Meanwhile, the `transferFrom()` function is used to transfer tokens from one address to another based on a previously approved allowance. The vulnerability arises when there is a race condition between these two functions.
Consider the following scenario:
- Address A approves Address B to spend a certain amount of tokens (let's say X) using the `approve()` function.
- Meanwhile, Address B initiates a call to `transferFrom()` to transfer X tokens from Address A to Address C.
- Before the `transferFrom()` function completes execution, Address A decides to change the allowance for Address B, either by reducing it, increasing it, or revoking it entirely.
This race condition can lead to unexpected behavior:
- If the `approve()` function is called before the `transferFrom()` function, but the allowance is changed before the `transferFrom()` function completes, the transfer might fail due to insufficient allowance.
- If the `transferFrom()` function is executed before the `approve()` function, but the allowance is set before the `transferFrom()` function completes, the transfer will proceed as expected.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for failed token transfers or transfers with incorrect amounts, leading to user frustration and possible loss of funds.
