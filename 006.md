# Reentrancy Vulnerability in OptimismPortal2's proveWithdrawalTransaction Allowing Timestamp Manipulation and Withdrawal Lockout

## Summary

Reentrancy vulnerability in the `proveWithdrawalTransaction` function of OptimismPortal2 contract that allows an attacker to re-prove a withdrawal and update the timestamp, potentially preventing other users from finalizing their withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `proveWithdrawalTransaction` function in the OptimismPortal2 contract updates the `provenWithdrawals` mapping and emits a `WithdrawalProven` event before checking if the withdrawal has already been proven. This creates a reentrancy vulnerability, as an attacker could exploit this by re-proving a withdrawal and updating the timestamp, which could prevent other users from finalizing their withdrawals.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it could lead to a denial of service (DoS) for users trying to finalize their withdrawals. By repeatedly re-proving a withdrawal and updating the timestamp, an attacker could effectively lock other users out of finalizing their withdrawals, causing potential financial losses and disrupting the system's functionality.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal2.sol#L317

The vulnerable code in the `proveWithdrawalTransaction` function is shown below:
```solidity
// Designate the withdrawalHash as proven by storing the `disputeGameProxy` & `timestamp` in the
// `provenWithdrawals` mapping. A `withdrawalHash` can only be proven once unless the dispute game it proved
// against resolves against the favor of the root claim.
provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash][msg.sender] =
    ProvenWithdrawal({ disputeGameProxy: gameProxy, timestamp: uint64(block.timestamp) });

// Emit a `WithdrawalProven` event.
emit WithdrawalProven(withdrawalHash, _tx.sender, _tx.target);

// Add the proof submitter to the list of proof submitters for this withdrawal hash.
proofSubmitters[withdrawalHash].push(msg.sender);
```
The checks to prevent re-proving a withdrawal should be performed before updating the `provenWithdrawals` mapping and emitting the `WithdrawalProven` event.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommend moving the checks for preventing re-proving a withdrawal before updating the `provenWithdrawals` mapping and emitting the `WithdrawalProven` event. The updated code should look like this:
```solidity
// Check if the withdrawal has already been proven by the current proof submitter
require(
    provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash][msg.sender].timestamp == 0,
    "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven by the current proof submitter"
);

// Designate the withdrawalHash as proven by storing the `disputeGameProxy` & `timestamp` in the
// `provenWithdrawals` mapping. A `withdrawalHash` can only be proven once unless the dispute game it proved
// against resolves against the favor of the root claim.
provenWithdrawals[withdrawalHash][msg.sender] =
    ProvenWithdrawal({ disputeGameProxy: gameProxy, timestamp: uint66(block.timestamp) });

// Emit a `WithdrawalProven` event.
emit WithdrawalProven(withdrawalHash, _tx.sender, _tx.target);

// Add the proof submitter to the list of proof submitters for this withdrawal hash.
proofSubmitters[withdrawalHash].push(msg.sender);
```
This change will ensure that the reentrancy vulnerability is mitigated, and users cannot exploit the function to re-prove withdrawals and update timestamps maliciously.
