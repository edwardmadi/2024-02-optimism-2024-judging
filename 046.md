# OptimismPortal2 not backward compatible after update

## Summary
After the current "OptimismPortal2" update, it will be completely switched to the new `FaultDisputeGame`.
The old `L2OutputOracle` will be completely abandoned
Transactions that were not executed before the update may no longer be executed

## Vulnerability Details
In `OptimismPortal2.sol` has commented out the old logic
So after the update, it is no longer possible to execute transactions after verification through `L2OutputOracle`
Old unexecuted transactions may not have a chance to be executed again for the following reasons
1. Unable to generate a valid `Game` for the old `OutputRootProof` because `Game.initialize()` restricts `l2BlockNumber()> rootBlockNumber`
2. Due to the need to submit a `bond` and , and you need to be familiar with the game mechanism, ordinary users simply cannot generate `Game` for ancient transactions. it may not be worth giving up on generating a new `Game`.
3. Due to the mechanism of Game, the old data may not be DEFENDER_WINS

Even if it can be re-proven, users may have to wait more than 7 days.

## Impact
Transactions that were not executed before the update may no longer be executed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Suggestion:
1. Backward compatibility, provide `proveWithdrawalTransactionForLegacy`, and still verify the legitimacy through `L2OutputOracle`
2. Cancel the new `propose` mechanism of `L2OutputOracle` and become read-only. New blocks can only be used through `Game`
