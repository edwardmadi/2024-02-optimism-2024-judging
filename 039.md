# USE CALL INSTEAD OF TRANSFER

## Summary
`transfer()` forwards 2300 gas only, which may not be enough in future if the recipient is a contract and gas costs change. it could break existing contracts functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
If gas costs are subject to change, then smart contracts can’t depend on any particular gas costs.
Any smart contract that uses transfer() or send() is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.

## Impact
Use of transfer() might render ETH impossible to withdraw because after istanbul hardfork, there is an increase in the gas cost of the SLOAD operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts.Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than 2300 gas, and they’ll now consume more, since 2300 the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s transfer() or send() methods. Any smart contract that uses transfer() or send() is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.
