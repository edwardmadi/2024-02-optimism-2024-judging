# DisputeGameFactory cant be set for OptimismPortal

## Summary

OptimismPortal2 introduced the `disputeGameFactory` variable. This variable can not be set after the contract upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `disputeGameFactory` variable is only set in the `initialize` function. This function wont be callable on the proxy after the upgrade, as it has been called before and the `_initialized` field is now already set on mainnet.

## Impact

The `disputeGameFactory` is used in the `proveWithdrawalTransaction` function. If its set to address(0), this function won't be callable and hence core functionality of the `OptimismPortal` will be rendered unusable until a further contract upgrade

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either:
1. create a reinitializer function
2. create a setter callable by a trusted entity
