# account can prevent the owner from pulling WETH

## Summary

an account can change allowance even if owner() decrease/increase allowance.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/weth/DelayedWETH.sol#L92-L96

## Vulnerability Detail

in the DElayedWETH it mentioned in the comments that the owner can pull WETH from any account and this happens by increasing 
the allowance in hold function but the problem is that the account you want the increase its allowance he could also decrease 
the allowance by calling approve and pass the owner address, and this may prevent the owner from pulling the WETH.

For Example:

guy   = address(0xaaaaaaaa); 
owner = address(0xffffffff); 

owner wants to change the allowance of guy address(0xaaaaaaaa)
```solidity
    function hold(address _guy, uint256 _wad) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner(), "DelayedWETH: not owner");
        allowance[address(0xaaaaaaaa)][address(0xffffffff)] = 5 ether; // <- _wad amount
        emit Approval(_guy, msg.sender, _wad);
    }
```

guy account can use approve to change the allowance before/after owner change it:
```solidity
    function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) external returns(bool) {
        allowance[address(0xaaaaaaaa)][address(0xffffffff)] = 0; // <- change the allowance amount
        emit Approval(msg.sender, guy, wad);
        return true;
    }
```

## Impact

account could change the allowance and prevent owner from pulling WETH and this is against what was mentioned in the comments 
in DelayedWETH contract where it says: 

DelayedWETH is meant to sit behind a proxy contract and has an owner address that can pull WETH from any account and can 
recover ETH from the contract itself.
