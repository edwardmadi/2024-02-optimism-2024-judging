# When the game is resolved, some claims may still be unresolved, causing their bonds to be locked in the contract.

## Summary

When the game is resolved, some claims may still be unresolved, causing their bonds to be locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function resolveClaim, when _claimIndex is equal to 0, subgameAtRootResolved will be set to True, which means that the game can be resolved (the game status will no longer be IN_PROGRESS when the resolve function is called again). Although the game is set up to resolve the underlying claims first, the function only checks whether the claim has subgames.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < challengeIndicesLen; ++i) {
    uint256 challengeIndex = challengeIndices[i];

    // INVARIANT: Cannot resolve a subgame containing an unresolved claim
    if (subgames[challengeIndex].length != 0) revert OutOfOrderResolution();
```

Therefore, when the subgames of rootClaim are not resolved, it is still allowed to set subgameAtRootResolved to True. Finally, these unresolved claims will be locked in contract when the function resolve is called (as status is no longer GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS).

## POC

```solidity
    function test_resolveClaim_lock() public {
        uint256 bal = 100 ether;
        vm.deal(address(this), bal);

        uint256 bond = _getRequiredBond(0);
        gameProxy.attack{ value: bond }(0, _dummyClaim());

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3 days + 12 hours + 1 seconds);
        gameProxy.resolveClaim(0);
        gameProxy.resolve();
        gameProxy.resolveClaim(1); // @@ failed

        // Wait for the withdrawal delay.
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + delayedWeth.delay() + 1 seconds);

        gameProxy.claimCredit(address(this));
        assertEq(address(this).balance, bal);
    }
```

Result:

![lockedClaims](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-optimism-2024-zrax-x/assets/52646245/8ab2b2ff-f4f0-4070-896b-b272b974b992)


## Impact

The bonds of claims will be locked in contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the claims to be resolved after the game is over. Or make sure every claims has been resolved while iterating through the subgames.
