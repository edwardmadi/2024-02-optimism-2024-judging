# Potential Stuck Ether in FaultDisputeGame Contract due to payable resolveClaim Function

## Summary

This audit report examines the FaultDisputeGame smart contract, focusing on the resolveClaim function. A vulnerability has been identified wherein the function defined as payable but does not process the msg.value amount, resulting in any ETH value being locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the resolveClaim function in the FaultDisputeGame contract. Although the function is payable, it does not process the transfer-in ETH adequately and lacks a withdraw function to release any excess ether. As a result, ETH sent to the contract becomes trapped within the contract.

// Findings are labeled with '<= FOUND'
```solidity
// File: src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol
405:    function resolveClaim(uint256 _claimIndex) external payable { // <= FOUND: FaultDisputeGame proxy resolveClaim function is payable, But does not process the transfer-in ETH and does not have a function to withdraw the ether either
406:        // INVARIANT: Resolution cannot occur unless the game is currently in progress.
407:        if (status != GameStatus.IN_PROGRESS) revert GameNotInProgress();
...
477:    }
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it results in ETH being locked within the contract, inaccessible to users. Any excess funds sent to the resolveClaim function will remain trapped, potentially causing financial loss or disruption to users who expect their funds to be handled correctly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to either implement a withdraw function to securely release any excess ether or remove the payable attribute from the resolveClaim function if it is not intended to receive funds directly.
